\TODO[motivation for meromorphic connections]

We will only be interested in local information and thus only in local local
classification of meromorphic connections.
This classification can be splittet in the coarse formal classification and the
fine meromorphic classification.

The formal classification problem was solved by the Levelt-Turittin theorem
(cf.\ theorem~\ref{thm:leveltTurittin}), which states, that in every formal
class are some spezial meromorphic connections of special form, i.e.\
meromorphic connections, which are isomorphic to some direct sum of elementary
meromorphic connections. They are called models.
These elementary meromorphic connections are well understood.

If we start with a formal equivalence class of meromorphic connections, which
is characterized by a model, we can apply the meromorphic classification.
The obtained set of meromorphic classes will be called the classifying set
(cf.\ section~\ref{sec:classifyingSet}).
The tool to describe the classifying set will be the Stokes structures which
turn out, to supply exactly the needed information.
Formulated is this in the Malgrange-Sibuya theorem
(cf.\ theorem~\ref{thm:mainThm1}), in which the Stokes structures appear as the
first cohomology $H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))$ of the Stokes sheaf
$\Lambda^{<0}(A^0)$ on $S^1$ (cf.\ definition~\ref{defn:StokesSheaf}).

The Malgrange-Sibuya theorem can be improved by showing, that in each element
in the $H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))$ cotains a unique cocycle, called the Stokes
cocyle (cf.\ definition~\ref{defn:stokesCocycle}), of spezial form, i.e.\ is
given by an element in the product of subgroups $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$
(cf.\ definition~\ref{defn:stokesGroup}) of $\Lambda_\theta^{<0}(A^0)$ at
\rewrite{spezial directions} $\theta\in\A$
(cf.\ definition~\ref{defn:antiStokesDir}).
We will see, that $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$ has faithful representation
$\SSto_\theta(A^0)$ (cf.\ proposition~\ref{prop:representation}).
The elements of $\SSto_\theta(A^0)$ are the so-called Stokes matrices and it is
easy to see, that they are nilpotent.
This can be used to define the structure of a nilpotent Lie group on the
classifying set.

Since we have seen, that a tuple of Stokes matrices represents exactly the
needed information, to describe a meromorphic class of a meromorphic
connection, and since we know which restrictions hold for these matrices we can
explicitly give the isomorphism $\C^n\to H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))$ for a
convenient $n$ (cf.\ section~\ref{sec:WhichInformationIsNeeded}).

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item first introduce asymptotic analysis
    \item then define languages for meromorphic connections or systems
    \item talk about Stokes structures
    \item more?
