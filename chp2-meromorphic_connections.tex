\chapter{Systems and meromorphic connections}
Here we will start with the definition of meromorphic connections on holomorphic
bundles although we will only be interested in local information.
For local description we will use \textbf{germs of meromorphic connections}, the
coordinate dependent \textbf{systems} and \textbf{connection matrices}.
Other coordinate independent approaches arise for example from the theory of
(localized holonomic) $\cD$-modules.

Meromorphic connections are introduced and discussed in many resources.
A good starting point are Sabbah's lecture notes~\cite{sabbah_cimpa90}.
More advanced resources are for example
Sabbah's book~\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic},
Varadarajan's book~\cite{Varadarajan96linearmeromorphic} or the
book~\cite{hotta2008} from Hotta et al.
The necessary facts about meromorphic connections are also stated in
Boalch's paper~\cite{boalch} (resp.\ his thesis~\cite{thboalch}),
and Loday-Richaud's paper~\cite{Loday1994}.

Although the language of meromorphic connections is often preferred, we will
use the language of systems most of the time.
Systems are, for example, discussed in the book~\cite{hotta2008} from Hotta et
al, Loday-Richaud's paper~\cite{Loday1994} and her book~\cite{Loday2014} and
Boalch's publications~\cite{boalch,thboalch}. Another resource \rewrite{might}
Remy's paper~\cite{Remy2014} be.

We will use \rewrite{all of the} above mentioned \rewrite{resources} in this
chapter.

\section{(Global) meromorphic connections}
Let $M$ be a riemanian surface and let $Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)>0$ be an
effective divisor\footnote{The $a_i\in M$ are distinct points and the $k_i$ are
positive integers.} on $M$.
It is sufficient to think $M=\P^1$ and $0\in|Z|$\footnote{If
$Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)$ then $|Z|:=\{a_1,\dots,a_m\}$.}, since we will
only be interested in local information (at $0$).

Let $\sM$ be a holomorphic bundle over $M$ i.e.\ a locally free $\cO_M$-module
of rank $n$.
A global meromorphic connection, i.e.\ a meromorphic connection on $\sM$, is
then defined as follows.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:mercon}
  A \emph{meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ on $\sM$ with poles on $Z$} is
  is defined by a $\C$-linear morphism of sheaves
  \[
    \nabla:\sM\to\Omega_M^1(*Z)\otimes\sM
  \]
  satisfying, for each open subset $U\underset{\text{op.}}{\subset} M$, the
  \emph{Leibniz rule}
    \[
      \nabla(fs)=f\nabla s+(df)\otimes s
    \]
  for $s\in\Gamma(U,\sM)$ and $f\in\cO_M(U)$.
  The \emph{rank} of the meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ is defined to be
  the rank of the Bundle $\sM$.
  It will usually denoted by the letter $n$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    Some authors use the factors $k_i$ of the divisor $Z$ to limit the pole
    orders at the points $a_i$. Since we do not need this restriction, we allow
    arbitrary pole orders. Denoted is this by the $*$ in $\Omega_M^1(*Z)$.

    The \emph{sheaf of meromorphic differential $1$-forms on $M$}
    $\Omega_M^1(*Z)$ is defined as
    \[
      \Omega_M^1(*Z):=\cO_M(*Z)\underset{\cO_M}\otimes\Omega_M^1 \,,
    \]
    where $\cO_M(*Z)$ is the sheaf of functions, which are meromorphic along
    $Z$.
    A detailed definition of these sheaves can be found in Sabbah's
    book~\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic} in
    Section 0.8 and Section 0.9.b
  \end{s-rem}
\end{defn}
The word ``global'' used to emphasize that the connection is ``on $\sM$'', i.e.\
not only a germ at some point of $M$, \rewrite{like it will be used} later
(cf.\ Remark~\ref{rem:GlobalNothingGerm}).

In the definition above is the variant `holomorphic bundle with meromorphic
connection' chosen, like in Boalch's paper~\cite{boalch}.
There is also the interchanged description `meromorphic bundle with holomorphic
connection' which is for example used in Sabbah's
book~\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic}.

By choosing a lattice of a meromorphic bundle
(cf.\ \cite[Def.0.8.3]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}), one gets a holomorphic bundle
but if the meromorphic bundle had a holomorphic connection, the induced
connection \rewrite{on the lattice} is no longer guaranteed to be holomorphic.
Thus we obtain a meromorphic connection on a holomorphic bundle in our sense.

We will only look at unramified connections. Some of the following statements
are only valid in the unramified case although we will not always mention this
restriction.

\begin{comment}
  \begin{defn}
    \marginnote{\cite[0.12.2]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
    The connection $\nabla:\sM\to \Omega_M^1\otimes_{\cO_M}\sM$ is said to be
    \emph{integrable} or \emph{flat}, if its curvature vanishes, i.e.\
    $R_\nabla\equiv0$
    where $R_\nabla:=\nabla\circ\nabla:\cE\to\Omega_M^2\otimes_{\cO_M}\cE$ is a
    $\cO_M$-linear morphism.
    \begin{s-rem}
      Here are all connections flat, since all connections will be of Dimension
      one.

\section{Local expression of meromorphic connections and systems}
\marginnote{\cite[28]{sabbah2007isomonodromic},
  \\\cite[2]{thboalch} and
  \\\cite[11]{babbitt1989local}}
We will only be interested in local information of meromorphic connections.
This means that we look at a connection in a neighbourhood of $0$ which has its
unique singularity at $0$.
There are several ways of expressing the local information without the need of
an fixed neighbourhood.
We will either talk about germs (at $0$) of meromorphic connections or systems,
which depend on the choice of a trivialization.
\begin{prop}
  \marginnote{\textbf{\cite[Rem.5.2.4]{hotta2008}}\\\cite[Def.4.2.1]{Loday2014}}
  A germ of a meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ is the sheaf-theoretic
  germ (at $t=0$) and thus is given by a tuple $(\cM,\nabla)$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\cM$ is the germ at $0$ of the holomorphic bundle $\sM$ and thus a
      $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-vectorspace of dimension $n$, since the ring of germs of
      meromorphic functions with poles at $0$ is the ring $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$, and
    \item $\nabla:\cM\to \cM$ is a $\C$-linear map, which
      satisfies the \emph{Leibniz rule}
      \[
        \nabla(fm)=\frac{d}{dt} f\cdot m + f\nabla(m)
      \]
      for all $f\in\C(\!\{t\}\!)$ and $m\in \cM$.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{s-rem}
    Loday-Richaud calls the germs of meromorphic connections in her
    book~\cite[Def.4.2.1]{Loday2014} \emph{differential modules}.
  \end{s-rem}
\end{prop}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:GlobalNothingGerm}
  From now on we will only talk about \textbf{germs of} meromorphic
  connections $(\cM,\nabla)$ and we will call them meromorphic connection. If
  we want to talk about meromorphic connections in the sense of
  Definition~\ref{defn:mercon} we will emphasize this by the word `global' or
  by talking about a meromorphic connection \textbf{on $M$}.
\end{rem}
It will occasionally be convenient to omit the $\nabla$ and simply call $\cM$
the meromorphic connection.
\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[Def.5.2.1]{hotta2008}}
  A \emph{(iso-)morphism of meromorphic connections}
  $\Phi:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\to(\cM',\nabla')$ is a (iso-)morphism of
  $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-vectorspaces $\Phi:\cM\overset{\sim}\to\cM'$ which commutes
  with the connections, i.e.\ which satisfies
  $\nabla\circ\phi = (\id\otimes\phi)\circ\nabla$.
\end{defn}
\marginnote{\cite[65]{Loday2014}, \cite[129]{hotta2008}}
Choose a $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-basis $\underline{e}=(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n)$ of $\cM$.
Let $A=(a_{jk})_{j,k\in\{1,\dots,n\}}$ be a $n\times n$ matrix with entries in
$\C(\!\{t\}\!)$ such that the it describes the action of $\nabla$ corresponding
to the chosen basis, i.e.\ satisfies
 $\nabla e_k=-\sum_{1\leq j\leq n} a_{jk}(t)e_j$ for every $k\in\{1,\dots,n\}$.
\begin{defn}
  The matrix $A$ is called a \emph{connection matrix} of $(\cM,\nabla)$.
\end{defn}
The connection $\nabla$ is fully determined by $A$. Indeed, let
$x=\sum_{0\leq j\leq n}x_je_j=\underline{e}\cdot X$ be an arbitrary element of
$\cM$, where $X={}^t\!(x_1,x_2 ,\dots,x_n)$ is a column matrix.
Applying $\nabla$ to $x$ using the Leibniz rule, yields
\begin{align*}
  \nabla x&=\nabla\left(\underline{e}\cdot X\right)
  \\&=\underline{e} \cdot dX + \nabla \underline{e} \cdot X
  \\&=\underline{e}\left(dX-AX\right).
\end{align*}
Such that horizontal sections of $(\cM,\nabla)$, i.e.\ sections which satisfy
$\nabla x=0$, correspond to solutions of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ode}
  \frac{d}{dt}x=Ax \,.
\end{equation}
Thus, with the connection $\nabla$ and the chosen $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-basis
$\underline{e}$, is naturally the differential operator
$\triangle=d-A$ associated, which has order one and dimension $n$.
\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[Sec.4]{Martinet1991}}
  We call (\ref{eq:ode}), determined by the differential operator
  $\triangle=d-A$, a \emph{germ of a meromorphic linear differential
  system\footnotemark} of rank $n$, or just a
  \emph{system}.
  \begin{s-prop}
    Thus, the set of systems is isomorphic to the set
    \[
      \End(E)\otimes\C(\!\{t\}\!)=\gl_n(\C(\!\{t\}\!))
    \]
    of all connection matrices.
  \end{s-prop}
  Such a system will be denoted by $[A]=d-A$ and we will call $A$ the
  connection matrix of the system $[A]$.
\end{defn}
  \footnotetext{Martinet and Ramis call them in~\cite{Martinet1991}
  \emph{germs of meromorphic differential operators.}}
\TODO[possibly multivalued solutions ($\tilde K$)?~\cite{hotta2008} on page
128]

If we start with a system $[A]$ and we want a meromorphic connection
$(\cM,\nabla)$ which has $A$ as connection matrix we can do this in the
following way.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:systToMeromConn}
  If we start with either a system $[A]$ of rank $n$, or a connection matrix
  $A\in\gl_n(\C(\!\{t\}\!))$, we get a germ of a meromorphic connection via
  \[
    (\cM_A,\nabla_A)=(\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n,d-A)
  \]
  which has $A$ as its connection matrix.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:MatOfSumOfMerCon}
  Let $(\cM_1,\nabla_1)$ and $(\cM_2,\nabla_2)$ be two meromorphic
  connections
  with the connection matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$.
  A connection matrix of $(\cM_1,\nabla_1)\oplus(\cM_1,\nabla_1)$ is then
  given
  by the block-diagonal matrix $\diag(A_1,A_2)$.
  \begin{s-cor}\label{cor:MatOfSumOfMerCon}
    Let $(\cM,\nabla)$ be an meromorphic connection, whose connection matrix
    can be written as $\diag(A_1,A_2)$.
    Then one can decompose the meromorphic connection corresponding to the block
    structure of $A$, i.e.\ $(\cM,\nabla)$ is then isomorphic to the direct sum
    $(\cM_{A^1},\nabla_{A^1})\oplus(\cM_{A^2},\nabla_{A^2})$
  \end{s-cor}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Use Proposition~\ref{prop:systToMeromConn} to write the connection as
  \[
    (\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_1},d-A_1)\oplus(\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_2},d-A_2)
  \]
  and we want to show that it is isomorphic to
  \[
    \left(\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_1+n_2},d-
    \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & 0 \\0 & A_2 \end{pmatrix}\right) \,.
  \]
  Denote by $A:=\diag(A_1,A_2)$ the block-diagonal matrix build from $A_1$ and
  $A_2$.
  For every $j\in\{1,2\}$ we have the inclusion
  $i_j:\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_j}\hookrightarrow\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_1+n_2}$ and the
  diagram
  \[ \begin{tikzcd}
      \C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_j} \rar{d-A_j}\dar{i_j} & \C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_j} \dar{i_j}
    \\\C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_1+n_2} \rar{d-A} & \C(\!\{t\}\!)^{n_1+n_2}
  \end{tikzcd} \]
  which commutes, since the derivation commutes with the inclusion and the
  matrix $A$ is build in the \rewrite{correct way}, to satisfy
  $i_j(A_jx)=A_j(i_j(x))$:
  \begin{align*}
    i_j(dx-A_jx) &= i_j(dx)-i_j(A_jx)
    \\&=d(i_j(x))-A_j(i_j(x))
    \\&=((d-A)\circ i_j)(x) \,.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

  $n$ which can be written as
  \[
    \underset{=:P}{\underbrace{%
        (a_n\partial_t^n+a_{n-1}\partial_t^{n-1}+\cdots a_{1}\partial_t+a_{0})

By \emph{meromorphic\footnote{We use the term meromorphic in the sens of
convergent meromorphic. Otherwise we say formal meromorphic.} transformation},
or just \emph{transformation}, of a system we mean a $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-linear
change of the trivialization.
Such a change is given by a matrix $F$ in
$G(\!\{t\}\!):=\Gl_n\left(\C\{t\}[t^{-1}]\right)$ and the transformed connection
matrix ${}^F\!A$ is obtained through the Gauge transformation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gaugeTrafo}
  {}^F\!A=(dF)F^{-1} + FAF^{-1} \,.
\end{equation}
Let $B:={}^F\!A$ be the transformed matrix and rewrite the equation
(\ref{eq:gaugeTrafo}) to obtain the linear differential equation
\[
    \frac{dF}{dt}=BF-FA
\]
which will be denoted by $[A,B]$.
\begin{rem}
  The system matrix $B$ is obtained from $A$ by transformation $F$ if and only
  if $F$ solves the linear differential system $[A,B]$.
\end{rem}

If $F$ is formal, i.e.\
$F\in G(\!(t)\!):=\Gl_n\left(\C\llbracket t\rrbracket[t^{-1}]\right)$, it will
usually be denoted by $\hat F$.
The transformation of $A$ by $\hat F\in$ G(\!(t)\!) is not guaranteed to have
convergent entries and thus is no system.
We denote by $\hat G(A)$ the set of all \emph{(applicable) formal
transformations}
\[
  \hat G(A):=\bigl\{\hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)
    \mid {}^{\hat F}\!A
    \text{ has convergent entries, i.e.\ ${}^{\hat F}\!A\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$}
  \bigr\}\,.
\]
Let $\hat{F'}\in\hat G(A)$ and $A':={}^{\hat{F'}}\!A$, then are the sets
$\hat G(A)$ and $\hat G(A')$ related by
\[
  \hat G(A')=\hat G(A)\hat{F'}^{-1}=\bigl\{
    \hat F\in G(\!\{t\}\!) \mid \hat F\hat{F'}\in\hat G(A)
  \bigr\} \,.
\]

\begin{rem}
  The Gauge transformations arise naturally from an isomorphism of meromorphic
  connections in the following way.
  If we start with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item two base choices $\cM\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n$
    and $\cM'\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n$ and
  \item an isomorphism
    $\Phi:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow(\cM',\nabla')$ together
    with the corresponding base change $F\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$
  \end{itemize}
  we have the following commutative diagram:
  \[ \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=.5cm,row sep=.5cm]
      \C(\!\{t\}\!)^n
      \arrow[green!60!black,thick]{rrrrr}{F}
      \arrow[green!60!black,thick]{dddd}{d-A}&&&&&
      \C(\!\{t\}\!)^n\arrow[green!60!black,thick]{dddd}{d-B}
      \\ & \cM \arrow{dd}{\nabla}\arrow{rrr}{\Phi}\ular&&&
      \cM'\arrow{dd}{\nabla'}\urar
      \\
      \\ & \cM \arrow{rrr}{\Phi}\dlar&&& \cM'\drar
      \\ \C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow[green!60!black,thick]{rrrrr}{F}&&&&&
      \C(\!\{t\}\!)^n
    \end{tikzcd} \]
  Thus the commutation property for the outer rectangle reads
  \[
    (d-B)\circ F=F\circ(d-A)
  \]
  which is equivalent to
  \[
    \frac{dF}{dt}=BF-FA.
  \]
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}\label{rem:distributingTransforamtionRule}
  The simple but useful rule
  \[
    {}^{(F_2F_1)}\!A =
    {}^{F_2}\!\left({}^{F_1}\!A\right)
  \]
  can be seen by calculation:
  \begin{align*}
    {}^{(F_2F_1)}\!A
    &= d(F_2F_1)(F_2F_1)^{-1}+F_2F_1 A(F_2F_1)^{-1}
  \\&=\left(
      \left(dF_2\right)̂F_1
      +F_2\left(dF_1\right)̂
    \right) F_1^{̀-1} F_2^{̀-1}
    +F_2F_1 A F_1^{̀-1}F_2^{̀-1}
  \\&= \left(dF_2\right)̂F_2^{-1}
     +F_2\left(dF_1\right)̂ F_1^{̀-1} F_2^{̀-1}
     +F_2
     \left(
       {}^{F_1}\!A-\left(dF_1\right)F^{-1}
     \right)
     F_2^{̀-1}
  \\&= \left(dF_2\right)̂F_2^{-1} +F_2 {}^{F_1}\!A F_2^{̀-1}
  \\&= {}^{F_2}\!\left({}^{F_1}\!A\right) \,.
  \end{align*}
\end{rem}
Let us now introduce equivalence relations on systems, which will correspond to
the isomorphism relations on meromorphic connections.
\begin{defn}
  We define the \emph{(formal) equivalence relation on the connection matrices
  (resp.\ on the corresponding systems)} as
  \begin{einr}
    \textbf{\boldmath$A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$}
  \end{einr}
  if and only if
  \begin{einr}
    \textbf{\boldmath$B$ is obtained from $A$ by (formal) transformation}.
  \end{einr}
  The \emph{class of a connection matrix} is the orbit under the Gauge
  transformation by $G(\!\{t\}\!)$. The \emph{formal class} is the orbit by
  $\hat G(A)$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    Thus $A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$ if and only if there is a (formal)
    solution of $[A,B]$.
  \end{s-rem}
\end{defn}

The defined equivalence relations are compatible with the \rewrite{isomorphisms
relations} on meromorphic connections (cf.\ \cite[Lem.5.1.3]{hotta2008}),
i.e.\ the following proposition holds.
\begin{prop}
  Two germs of meromorphic connections are (formally) isomorphic if and only if
  their corresponding connection matrices are (formally) equivalent.
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}\label{defn:isotropies}
  \marginnote{\cite[853]{Loday1994}}
  An \emph{isotropy} of $A^0$ or of $[A^0]$ is a transformation
  $\hat F$ which satisfies ${}^{\hat F}\!A^0=A^0$.
  Thus, the isotropies are the solutions of the system
  $[\End A^0]:=[A^0,A^0]$.

  Let $G_0(A^0)$ denote the set of all isotropies of $A^0$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    The isotropies are, a priori, formal transformations.
    Loday-Richaud mentions in her paper~\cite[853]{Loday1994}, that $G_0(A^0)$
    is actually a subgroup of $\Gl_n(\C[1/t,t])$.
  \end{s-rem}
  \begin{s-lem}
    \marginnote{\cite[854]{Loday1994}}
    Two formal transformations $\hat F_1$ and $\hat F_2$ take $A^0$ into
    equivalent matrices ${}^{\hat F_1}\!A^0$ and  ${}^{\hat F_2}\!A^0$ if and
    only if there exists isotropy $f_0\in G_0(A^0)$ such that
    $\hat F_1=\hat F_2f_0$ (cf.~\cite[854]{Loday1994}).

$x_0(t)$ and $x_{00}(t)$ are two solution of (\ref{eq:ode}) and $c_1$,

The Stokes phenomenon, which will be discussed in the

fundamental solution, which solves a system on the full arc $S^1$.
But holomorphic solutions, which are asymptotic to the formal solution, may
exist only on small sub-sectors of $S^1$. The Stokes structures are then
roughly the information about the relation between the holomorphic solutions on the overlap

\section{Formal classification}\label{sec:formalClassification}
\marginnote{\cite[Thm.4.3.1]{Loday2014}}
In every formal equivalence class of meromorphic connections, there are some
meromorphic connections of special form, which we will call models. They are
not unique but all of them, which are formally isomorphic to a given
meromorphic connection, lie in the same convergent equivalence class.
In fact, every element of this convergent equivalence class will be a model in
our definition.

The models will be used to classify meromorphic connections up to formal
isomorphism. Two meromorphic connections are formally isomorphic, if they are
isomorphic to the (up to convergent isomorphism) same model. In the language of
systems will normal forms be the objects, which correspond to models.

This is essentially given by the Levelt-Turittin Theorem, which states that each
meromorphic connection is, after potentially needed ramification, formally
isomorphic to such a model. Thus the Levelt-Turittin Theorem solves the formal
classification problem.

\subsection{In the language of meromorphic connections: models}
We will start by defining the models in the language of meromorphic connections.
This approach is discussed by Sabbah in~\cite{sabbah_cimpa90} and in a more
general context in~\cite[Sec.II.5]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:elemnMerConnBausteine}
  For $\alpha\in\C$, define the \emph{elementary regular meromorphic
    connection of rank one} $\cN_{\alpha,0}$ as the germ
  \[
    (\cN_{\alpha,0},\nabla):=\left(\C(\!\{t\}\!),d+\frac{\alpha}{t}\right)
    \,.
  \]
  This corresponds to the system satisfied by $t^{-\alpha}$.

  \marginnote{\cite[Defn.II.2.5]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  An \emph{elementary regular model of arbitrary rank} is a meromorphic
  connection which has a basis, in which the connection Matrix can be
  written as
  \[
    \frac{1}{t} (\alpha\id+N)
  \]
  where $N\in\gl_{d+1}(\C)$ is a nilpotent matrix.
  If $\alpha\id + N$ is a single Jordan Block, we denote the corresponding
  connection by $\cN_{\alpha,d}$.
\end{defn}
The Corollary~\cite[Cor.II.2.9]{sabbah2007isomonodromic} in Sabbah's book
states, that every germ of a regular meromorphic connection $(\cR,\nabla)$ is
isomorphic to some direct sum
\[
  (\cR,\nabla)\cong\bigoplus_{\alpha,d}(\cN_{\alpha,d},\nabla)\,.
\]
of elementary regular meromorphic connections.
The rough idea to proof this is to use Theorem~\ref{thm:regularConnConstMat}
and assume that the connection matrix $A$ of $(\cR,\nabla)$ is constant.
Since the Gauge transformation by a constant matrix $F\in\Gl(\C)$ is given by
${}^F\!A=FAF^{-1}$, i.e.\ a similarity transformation, one can find a
transformation $F$ such that ${}^F\!A$ is in Jordan normal form.
One can then use Corollary~\ref{cor:MatOfSumOfMerCon} to decompose the
corresponding to the structure of the Jordan normal form and obtain the result.
This solves the classification problem, for regular meromorphic connections.
For a detailed analysis of regular meromorphic connections see Sabbah's
book~\cite[Sec.II.2]{sabbah2007isomonodromic} or the
book~\cite[Sec.5.2]{hotta2008} from Hotta et al.

The simplest irregular meromorphic connections will be called elementary and
are defined below.
\begin{defn}
  For a $\phi\in\C(\!\{t\}\!)$ we use $\cE^{\phi}$ to denote the meromorphic
  connection
  \[
    (\cE^{\phi},\nabla):=(\C(\!\{t\}\!),d-\phi')\,.
  \]
  This corresponds to the system satisfied by the function $e^\phi$, since
  $(d-\phi')e^\phi=0$.
  \begin{s-prop}\label{cor:uniqueAmbassadorForPhi}
    $\cE^\phi$ is determined by the class of $\phi$ in
    $\C(\!\{t\}\!)/\C\{t\}\cong t^{-1}\C[t^{-1}]$. In the following, we will
    only assume, that $\phi$ is always given by the unique ambassador which has
    no holomorphic part.
  \end{s-prop}
  \marginnote{\cite[Def.II.5.2]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  A germ $(\cM,\nabla)$ is called \emph{elementary} if it is isomorphic to some
  germ $(\cE^\phi,\nabla)\otimes(\cR,\nabla)$ where $(\cR,\nabla)$ has regular
  singularity at $\{0\}$, i.e.\ is isomorphic to a direct sum of regular
  elementary meromorphic connections.
  \marginnote{\cite[II.2.f]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}\label{defn:model}
  \def\myPhi{\textcolor{red!60!black}{\phi}}
  \def\myE{\textcolor{green!40!black}{\cE^{\myPhi}}}
  A germ $(\cM',\nabla')$ is a \emph{model} if there exists after ramification
  $\cM=\pi^*\cM'$ by $\pi$ a isomorphism
  \[
    \lambda:(\cM,\nabla) \overset{\cong}{\longrightarrow}
    \bigoplus_{\phi} \cE^\phi \otimes \cR_{\phi}
  \]
  to a direct sum of elementary meromorphic connections where the
  $\phi\in t^{-1}\C[t^{-1}]$ are pairwise distinct and the $\cR_{\phi}$ have
  regular singularity.
  \begin{s-rem}
    Here it is not necessary to understand ramification, since we restrict to
    the unramified case.
  \end{s-rem}
\end{defn}
The important theorem here is the Levelt-Turittin Theorem, which solves the
formal classification problem.
\begin{thm}[Levelt-Turittin decomposition]\label{thm:leveltTurittin}
  To each germ $(\cM',\nabla')$ of a meromorphic connection there exists, after
  potentially needed pullback $\pi^{*}\textcolor{black}{\cM'}=:\cM$ by some
  suitable ramification $t=z^q$ of order $q\geq1$, a \textbf{formal} isomorphism
  \[
    \hat{\lambda}:\hat{\cM}\overset{\cong}\longrightarrow
    \hat{\textcolor{black}{\cM}}^{nf}:=\hat\cO_M\otimes\cM^{nf}
  \]
  to a model $\cM^{nf}$.
  We then call $\cM^{nf}$ a \emph{formal decomposition} or \emph{formal model}
  of $\cM$ or $\cM'$.
  \begin{s-rem}\label{rem:leveltTurittin}
    But there is in general \textbf{no} lift of the isomorphism $\hat\lambda$,
    i.e.\ there is no isomorphism making the diagram
    \[ \begin{tikzcd}
        \cM \dar \arrow[dotted]{r}[description]{?} & \cM^{nf} \dar
        \\\hat\cM \rar{\hat\lambda} & \hat\cM^{nf}
    \end{tikzcd} \]
    commutative.
    But sectorwise, there are lifts given by the main asymptotic existence
    theorem (cf.\ Theorem~\ref{thm:maet}).
  \end{s-rem}
\end{thm}
Proofs of this theorem can be found in multiple places, for example in
\cite[Thm.5.4.7]{sabbah_cimpa90} or in~\cite{myBa}.

\subsection{In the language of systems: normal forms}\label{sec:normalForms}
\marginnote{\cite{Remy2014}
           \\,\cite[146]{sibuya1990Linear}}
Here we will see that the fundamental solution of a model can be written in a
special form and that this property characterizes models. This will be used to
define normal forms which will be models on the level of systems.
\begin{defn}
  The fundamental solution corresponding to a model (resp.\ a normal form, see
  Definition~\ref{defn:normSol}) will be called a
  \emph{normal solution}.
\end{defn}

Let $(\cM,\nabla)$ be an unramified meromorphic connection which is via some
$\hat\lambda$ formally isomorphic to some model
$\cM^{nf}=\bigoplus_{j=1}^s\cE^{\phi_j}\otimes\cR_j$, where we assume that
$\phi_j\in t^{-1}\C[t^{-1}]$ (cf.~Corollary~\ref{cor:uniqueAmbassadorForPhi}).
For every $j$ is a connection matrix, corresponding to $\cR_j$ given by
$\frac{1}{t}L_j$, where $L$ is in Jordan normal form.
A connection matrix to $\cE^{\phi_j}\otimes\cR_j$ is then by
$q_j'(t^{-1})\cdot\id_{n_j}+\frac{1}{t}L_j$ given\TODO[(cf.~???)], where
$q_j(t^{-1})=\phi_j(t)$\PROBLEM[repl. all $\phi$ by $q$?] is a polynomial in
$t^{-1}$ without constant term and
$q_j'(t^{-1})=\frac{d}{dt}\phi_j(t)$\footnote{By abuse of notation we denote by
  $q_j'(t^{-1})$ the derivation $\frac{d}{dt}(q_j(t^{-1}))=
  \left(\left(\frac{d}{dt}q_j\right)\circ t^{-1}\right) \cdot\frac{d}{dt}t^{-1}$.
  The same does apply for $Q'(t^{-1})$.}.
A connection matrix for $\cM^{nf}$ is then obtained by
\begin{align*}
  A^0&= \bigoplus_{j=1}^s
       \left(q_j'(t^{-1})\cdot\id_{n_j}+\frac{1}{t}L_j\right)
  \\ &=\bigoplus_{j=1}^sq_j'(t^{-1})\cdot\id_{n_j}
       +\frac{1}{t}\bigoplus_{j=1}^sL_j
  \\ &=Q'(t^{-1})+\frac{1}{t}L \,,
\end{align*}
where
$Q(t^{-1}):=\bigoplus_{j=1}^sq_j(t^{-1})\cdot\id_{n_j}$
and $L:=\bigoplus_{j=1}^sL_j$.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:structureComparison}
  Let $L$ be a block diagonal matrix $L=\bigoplus_{j=1}^sL_j$, where the $L_j$
  are of size $n_j\times n_j$ and let $Q$ be a diagonal matrix.
  We will say that \emph{the block structure of $L$ is finer then the
  structure of $Q$} if there are $q_j$'s such that
  $Q=\bigoplus_{j=1}q_j\cdot\id_{n_j}$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    \begin{enumerate}\label{rem:structureComparison}
      \item The matrices $Q$ and $L$ defined above clearly satisfy this
        condition.
      \item When this condition is satisfied do $L$ and $Q$ commute.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{s-rem}
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:fundSolBuilder}
  Let $L\in \GL_n(\C)$ be constant and
  $Q(t^{-1})=\diag(q_1(t^{-1}),\dots,q_n(t^{-1}))$ a diagonal matrix of
  polynomials in $t^{-1}$ where $L$ is in Jordan normal form and its block
  structure is finer then the structure of the derivative $Q(t^{-1})$.

  The matrix $\cY_0:=t^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}$ is then a fundamental solution of the
  system determined by the matrix
  \[
    A^0=Q'(t^{-1})+L\frac{1}{t} \,.
  \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  It is easy to see (or cf.~\cite[Appendix C.1]{Balser2000Formal}) that the
  block structure of $t^L$ is finer then the structure of $Q'(t^{-1})$ and thus
  $t^LQ'(t^{-1})t^{-L}=Q'(t^{-1})$, since the block structure is preserved under
  the exponential and derivation.
  Thus we can prove that $\cY_0$ is a matrix consisting of solutions:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{dt}\cY_0
    &=\frac{d}{dt}\left(t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}\right)
  \\&= t^L\frac{d}{dt}e^{Q(t^{-1})} + \frac{d}{dt}t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \\&= t^LQ'(t^{-1})e^{Q(t^{-1})} + L\frac{1}{t}t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}
  % \\&=L\frac{1}{t}t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}+Q'(t^{-1})t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \\&=\left(t^LQ'(t^{-1})t^{-L}+L\frac{1}{t}\right)t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \\&=\left(Q'(t^{-1})+L\frac{1}{t}\right)t^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \\&=A^0\cY_0 \,.
  \end{align*}
  The invertability condition is clear.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
  If one starts without the assumption on the structure, one only obtains
  \[
    A=t^LQ'(t^{-1})t^{-L}+L\frac{1}{t}
  \]
  as possible system matrix. But the obtained matrix may not define a system,
  since it could contain entries, which are not in $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$.

  A simple example where this happens is given by
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $L=\begin{pmatrix} \alpha & 1 \\ 0 & \alpha \end{pmatrix}$ and
  \item $Q=\begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \phi_2 \end{pmatrix}$,
  \end{itemize}
  with $\phi_1\neq\phi_2$.
  The matrix $A$ is then
  \begin{align*}
    A  &=t^LQ'(t^{-1})t^{-L}+L\frac{1}{t}
    \\ &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \phi_1' & (-\phi_1'+\phi_2')\ln(t)
      \\0     & \phi_2'
    \end{pmatrix}
    +
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \alpha & 1
        \\ 0   & \alpha
    \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{t}
    \notin\gl_n(\C(\!\{t\}\!))
    \,.
  \end{align*}
\end{rem}
To $\hat\lambda$ and the (implicitly) used choices of bases corresponds a
formal transformation $\hat F$ and thus we have
\begin{itemize}
\item a fundamental solution $\hat Ft^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}$ (cf.\
  Remark~\ref{rem:fundChangeOnFund}) and
\item a connection matrix ${}^{\hat F}\!A^0$
\end{itemize}
of the meromorphic connection $(\cM,\nabla)$, which was defined at the beginning
of this subsection.
\begin{cor}
  From the Levelt-Turittin theorem we deduce that every meromorphic connection
  $(\cM,\nabla)$ and thus every system $[A]$ has a fundamental solution of the
  form
  \[
    \mathcal{Y}=\hat F t^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \]
  where $\hat F$ is a formal transformation, solving the differential equation
  corresponding to the formal isomorphism
  $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})\to(\cM,\nabla)$.
  On the other hand is a system, which has $\cY$ as fundamental solution, given
  by the connection matrix
  \[
    \bar A={}^{\hat F}\!\left(Q'(t^{-1})+L\frac{1}{t}\right) \,.
  \]
  \begin{comment}
    \begin{s-rem}
      It is always possible to permutate the columns of a fundamental solution
      by
      \[
        P^{-1}\mathcal{Y}P=\hat F t^{P^{-1}LP} e^{P^{-1}Q(t^{-1})P}
      \]
      with a permutation matrix $P$ and \rewrite{obtain another fundamental
      solution for the same system} (cf.\ \cite[73]{Loday2014}).
    \end{s-rem}
  \end{comment}
\end{cor}
In the special case when $\hat\lambda$ is a convergent isomorphism, i.e.\ in
the case, when $A$ is already a model, we see that it has a fundamental
solution of the form $Ft^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}$, where $F$ is a convergent
transformation corresponding to $\hat\lambda$.
In fact are the models uniquely characterized as the meromorphic connections,
with a fundamental solution which can be written as $\cY_0=Ft^Le^{Q(t^{-1})}$
and we will use this fact to say when a system is something corresponding to a
model.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:normSol}
  Let $[A]$ be a system.
  We call $[A]$ (or $A$) a \emph{normal form} if a fundamental solution of
  $[A]$ can be written as
  \[
    \mathcal{Y}_0(t)=F t^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \]
  with
  \begin{itemize}
    \item an \emph{irregular part} $e^{Q(t^{-1})}$ of $\mathcal{Y}_0$
      determined by
      \[
        Q(t^{-1})=\underset{j=1}{\overset{s}{\bigoplus}}q_j(t^{-1})\id_{n_j}
          =\diag(\underset{n_1\text{-times}}{\underbrace{%
          q_1,\dots,q_1}},q_2,\dots,q_s)
      \]
      where the $q_i(t^{-1})$ are polynomials in $\frac{1}{t}$ (or in a
      fractional power $\frac{1}{s}=\frac{1}{t^{1/p}}$ of $\frac{1}{t}$ for the
      ramified case) such that $q_j(0)=0$, i.e.\ without constant term,
    \item a constant matrix $L\in\gl_n(\C)$ called the \emph{matrix of formal
      monodromy}, where $t^L$ means $e^{L\ln t}$ and
    \item a (convergent) transformation $F\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$.
      \begin{s-rem}
        By changing the basis via $F^{-1}$ we obtain from $[A^0]$ the
        equivalent system $[{}^{F^{-1}}\!A^0]$ with the normal solution
        $F^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_0(t)=t^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}$.
        Thus it is always possible to assume that the transformation matrix $F$
        is trivial.
      \end{s-rem}
  \end{itemize}
  The normal forms will often be denoted $A^0$.
  If $A$ is formally equivalent to a normal form $A^0$ we say that $A^0$
  \emph{is a normal form for} $A$ and for $[A]$.
\end{defn}
\begin{cor}\label{cor:structuralAssumptions}
  Since we only look at unramified connections, we are able to assume that $L$
  is in Jordan normal form and that it has a block structure, which is finer
  then the structure of $Q=\bigoplus_{j=1}^sq_j(t^{-1})\cdot\id_{n_j}$
  (cf.~\cite[Sec.1]{Remy2014} or~\cite[Sec.4]{Martinet1991}).
\end{cor}
The following corollary enables us to use normal forms in place of models.
\begin{cor}
  A meromorphic connection $(\cM,\nabla)$ is a model if and only if its
  connection matrix $A$ is a normal form.

% \end{thm}
% \begin{proof}
%   \textbf{``\Rightarrow{}'':}
%   Let $\cM=\bigoplus_{\phi}\cE^\phi\otimes\cR_\phi$ be a model and let us
%   first fix a $\phi$ and look at the connection $\cE^\phi\otimes\cR_\phi$.
%   We know that $\cR_\phi$ is a direct sum of regular elementary meromorphic
%   connections whose fundamental matrices are of the form
%   $\frac{1}{t}(\alpha\id+N)$ where $\alpha\in\C$ and $N$ is nilpotent
%   (cf.\ Definition~\ref{defn:elemnMerConnBausteine}).
%   Thus the connection matrix for $\cR_\phi$ writes as
%   \[
%     \frac{1}{t} \bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)
%     \,.
%   \]
%   A connection matrix of $\cE^\phi\otimes\cR_\phi$ is then given\PROBLEM[!]
%   by
%   \[
%     t^{\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%     \left(-\phi'\id\right)
%     t^{-\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%     + \frac{1}{t} \bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right) \,.
%   \]
%   Since $\cM$ is a sum of such elementary connections, The connection matrix
%   of $\cM$ writes as
%   \[
%     \bigoplus_\phi\left(
%       - t^{\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%       \left(\phi'\id\right)
%       t^{-\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%       +
%       \frac{1}{t} \bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)
%     \right) \,,
%   \]
%   which can be rewritten as
%   \[
%     \underset{t^LQ'(t^{-1})t^{-L}}{
%       \underset{\text{\rotatebox[origin=c]{-90}{$=$}}}{%
%         \underbrace{-\bigoplus_\phi
%           \left(
%             t^{\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%             \left(\phi'\id\right)
%             t^{-\bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)}
%           \right)
%         }
%       }
%     }
%     +
%     \frac{1}{t}
%     \underset{L}{
%       \underset{\text{\rotatebox[origin=c]{-90}{$=$}}}{%
%         \underbrace{%

%           \right)
%         }
%       }
%     }
%     \,.
%   \]
%   Thus it has
%   \[
%     t^{\bigoplus_\phi\left(
%         \bigoplus_{(\alpha,N)}\left( \alpha\id+N\right)
%     \right)}
%     e^{-\bigoplus_\phi\phi'\id}

Here we want to state the main asymptotic expansion theorem (or often M.A.E.T.)
which is essentially a deduction from the Borel-Ritt Lemma.
\marginnote{\cite[207]{Balser2000Formal}}
It states that to every formal solution of a system of meromorphic differential
equations and every sector with sufficiently small opening, one can find a
holomorphic solution of the system having the formal one as its asymptotic
expansion.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:lift}
  \marginnote{\cite[855]{Loday1994}}
  Let $A$ be via $\hat F$ formally equivalent to $A^0$.
  We call $F$ a \emph{lift of $\hat F$ on $I\subset S^1$} if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $F\sim_I\hat F$
      (cf.\ Page~\pageref{page:notationForAsymptoticExpansion}) and
    \item $F$ satisfies the same system $[A^0,A]$ as $\hat F$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
The following theorem, often called the main asymptotic existence theorem, can
be for example found in as Theorem A in the paper~\cite{BJL1979Birkhoff} from
Balser, Jurkat and Lutz, Theorem 3.1 in Boalch's paper~\cite{boalch}
or Theorem 4.4.1 in Loday-Richaud's Book~\cite{Loday2014}.
\begin{thm}[M.A.E.T]\label{thm:maet}
  To every $\hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)$ and to every small enough arc
  $I\subsetneq S^1$ there exists a lift $F$ on $I$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    \marginnote{\cite[Thm.4.4.1]{Loday2014}}
    If we write the system $[A^0,A]$ as a differential operator $\triangle$.
    The theorem then states that $\triangle$ acts surjectively on the sheaf
    $\cA^{<0}$, i.e.\ the sequence
    \[
      \cA^{<0}\overset{\triangle}\longrightarrow\cA^{<0} \longrightarrow 0

    is an exact sequences of sheaves of $\C$-vector spaces.

  \PROBLEM[Think about it?]
  In the language of meromorphic connections is this theorem sometimes called
  \emph{sectorial decomposition} and stated for example
  in~\cite[Thm.II.5.12]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}
  and~\cite[Sec.II.2.4]{sabbah_cimpa90}:

    There exists then, for any $e^{i\theta^0}\in S^1$, an isomorphism
    $\tilde\lambda_{\theta^0}:
    \tilde\cM_{\theta^0}=\cA_{\theta^0}\otimes\cM\to\tilde\cM_{\theta^0}^{nf}$

\section{The classifying set}\label{sec:classifyingSet}
We want to understand the Set
$\bigl\{\big[(\cM,\nabla)\big]\bigr\}$ of the (convergent)
isomorphism classes of all meromorphic connections. Since we can use the formal
classification (cf.\ Section~\ref{sec:formalClassification}) and we know that
the convergent classification is \rewrite{finer} than the formal classification,
we can reduce the problem by fixing a model $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ with the
corresponding normal form $A^0$.
\rewrite{Thus we can} restrict to the subset
\begin{multline*}
  {}^0C(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})=\bigl\{
    \bigl[(\cM,\nabla)\bigr]
    \mid \text{there exists a formal isomorphism }
  \\\qquad\hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
      \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
      (\hat\cM^{nf},\hat\nabla^{nf})
  \bigr\}
\end{multline*}
of all isomorphism classes of meromorphic connections, which are formally
isomorphic to $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$. This is the set that we will be
calling the \emph{classifying set (to $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$)} and we will
also denote it also by ${}^0C(A^0)$, if we are using the language of systems.
\begin{rem}
  Note that we classify
  \begin{einr}
    meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal meromorphic classes,
    modulo meromorphic equivalence}.
  \end{einr}
  Whereas for example Boalch in~\cite{boalch,thboalch} classifies
  \begin{einr}
    meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal analytic classes,
    modulo analytic equivalence}
  \end{einr}
  as it was done in the older literature.
  This makes no difference, since the resulting classifying sets are isomorphic
  (cf.~\cite{thboalch} or~\cite{babbitt1989local}).

  This distinction relates to the difference between \textbf{‘regular
  singular’} connections and \textbf{‘logarithmic’} connections
  (cf.~\cite[Rem.1.41]{thboalch}).
\end{rem}
\marginnote{\cite[6]{thboalch}
  \\\tiny{(\cite[19]{boalch})}
  \\\cite[852]{Loday1994}
  \\\cite[111]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}
  \\\cite{babbitt1983}}
It is convenient to look at the slightly larger space of isomorphism classes of
\emph{marked (meromorphic) pairs}
\[
  \cH(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})=\bigl\{
    \bigl[(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)\bigr]
      \mid
      \hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
        \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
        (\hat\cM^{nf},\hat\nabla^{nf})
  \bigr\}
\]
in which we also handle the additional information of the formal isomorphism by
which the meromorphic connection is isomorphic to the model.
The isomorphisms of marked pairs are defined as expected:
\begin{defn}\label{defn:isomsOfPairs}
  Two germs $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ and $(\cM',\nabla',\hat f')$ are
  isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
  $g:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow(\cM',\nabla')$ such that
  $\hat f=\hat f'\circ \hat g$.
  \begin{s-rem}
    \rewrite{Sabbah states in} \cite[111]{sabbah2007isomonodromic} that such
    an isomorphism is then unique.
  \end{s-rem}
\end{defn}

Equivalently, one can talk in terms of systems. We then denote by
\[
  \Syst_m(A^0):=\bigl\{[A]
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\bigr\}
\]
the set of systems formally meromorphic equivalent to $A^0$.
Since we use meromorphic equivalences, in contrast to \cite{boalch,thboalch},
we denote that in $\Syst_m$ by the subscript ${}_m$.
Thus ${}^0C(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ corresponds to
the set ${}^0C(A^0):=\Syst_m(A^0)/G(\!\{t\}\!)$ of meromorphic classes which
are formally equivalent to $A^0$.
Analogous, $\cH(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ corresponds to the set $\cH(A^0)$ of
equivalence classes, i.e.\ orbits of $G(\!\{t\}\!)$, in
\label{page:ofDefnOfIsomOfMarkedPairs}
\[
  \hat\Syst_m(A^0):=\bigl\{\bigl(A,\hat F\bigl)
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\bigl\} \,.
\]
The isomorphisms defined in Definition~\ref{defn:isomsOfPairs} translate into
the following equivalence relation:
\begin{einr}
  two marked pairs $(A,\hat F)$ and $(A',\hat F')$ are equivalent, if and only
  if there is a base change $H$ such that
  \PROBLEM[$H\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$? or asymptotic functions?]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A'={}^{H}\!A$, i.e.\ $H$ is a solution of $[A,A']$, and
  \item $\hat F'=\hat H\hat F$ (cf.\ \cite[71]{babbitt1989local}).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{einr}
In the following diagram the first condition is equivalent to the commutativity
of the \textcolor{green!60!black}{green} square. The second property corresponds
to the commutation property of the top (resp.\ bottom) triangle on the level of
asymptotic expansions.
\[ \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=1cm,row sep=.5cm]
  &&&\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow[green!60!black, thick]{ddd}{d-A}
    \arrow[green!60!black, thick]{ddr}{H}
\\\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow{rrru}{\hat F}
  \arrow[ultra thick, white]{rrrrd}{\hat F'}
  \arrow{rrrrd}{\hat F'}
  \arrow{ddd}{d-A^0}
\\&&&&\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow[green!60!black, thick]{ddd}{d-A'}
\\&&&\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow[green!60!black, thick]{ddr}{H}
\\\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n \arrow{rrru}{\hat F} \arrow{rrrrd}{\hat F'}
\\&&&&\C(\!\{t\}\!)^n
\end{tikzcd} \]

\begin{lem}
  \marginnote{\url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Stabilizer.html}}
  Since $G_0(A^0)$ is by definition the stabilizer of $A^0$ (cf.\
  definition~\ref{defn:isotropies}) and $\Syst_m(A^0)$ is the corresponding
  orbit we can use the Proposition 3.1 of the
  book~\cite{wielandt1964finite} from Wielandt and deduce
  \[
    \Syst_m(A^0)\cong \hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0) \,.
  \]
  \begin{s-cor}\label{cor:isomorphyOfClassfset}
    \marginnote{\cite[Eq.1.9b]{babbitt1983}}
    Thus the \emph{set of meromorphic classes of systems formally equivalent
    to $A^0$} are just the orbits of $G(\!\{t\}\!)$ in $\Syst_m(A^0)$ that is
    \[
      {}^0C(A^0)\cong G(\!\{t\}\!)\backslash\hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0)
    \]
    whereas the \emph{set of meromorphic classes of marked pairs $\cH(A^0)$
    of $[A^0]$} is canonically isomorphic to the left quotient
    $G(\!\{t\}\!)\backslash\hat G(A^0)$ (cf.\ \cite[Lem.1.17]{thboalch}).
  \end{s-cor}
\end{lem}
The group $G_0(A^0)$ is easy to compute and is often trivial. In fact are the
elements of $G_0(A^0)$ block-diagonal corresponding to the structure of $Q$,
see~\cite[77]{Loday2014}.
Thus the structure of ${}^0C(A^0)$ is easily deduced from the structure of
$G(\!\{t\}\!)\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.
