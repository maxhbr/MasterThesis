  \chapter{Global moduli space}
  Let $M$ be a riemanian surface and let $Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)>0$ be an
  effective divisor\footnote{The $a_i$ are distinct points and the $k_i$ are
  positive integers.} on $M$.

  If we look at a meromorphic connection \TODO[\dots]

  To understand the global moduli space of meromorphic connections, the stokes
  structures at the points $a_i$ are not enough. The additionally needed
  information is, for example, given by the tentacles defined in
  \cite[Chap.4]{thboalch}.
