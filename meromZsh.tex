There are multiple languages, which can be used for talking about meromorphic
connections. Firstly the languages of meromorphic connections, and also
$\cD$-modules\TODO[global]. These two can be used to talk about global
information. For local description one can use germs of meromorphic connections
or $\cD$-modules\TODO[local] which are coordinate independent. Coordinate
dependent alternatives are (local) systems and connection matrices. Also, one
can use the fundamental solutions to describe local informations of meromorphic
connections.

Let $M$ be a riemanian surface and let $Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)>0$ be an
effective divisor\footnote{The $a_i$ are distinct points and the $k_i$ are
positive integers.} on $M$.
It is sufficient to think $M=\P^1$ and $Z=1(0)+1(\infty)$\TODO[\infty?], since
we will only be interested in local information (at $0$).

Let $\sM$ be a holomorphic Bundle over $M$ i.e.\ a locally free $\cO_M$-module
of rank $n$.

A meromorphic connection is then defined as follows.
\begin{defn}
  \def\myU{\textcolor{green!30!black}{U}}
  \def\mys{\textcolor{blue!60!black}{s}}
  \def\myf{\textcolor{red!60!black}{f}}
  A \emph{meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ on $\sM$ with poles on $Z$}
  is defined by a $\C$-linear morphism of sheaves
  \[
    \nabla:\sM\to\Omega_M^1(*Z)\otimes\sM
  \]
  satisfying, for each $\myU\underset{\text{op.}}{\subset} M$, the
  \emph{Leibniz rule}
    \[
      \nabla(\myf\mys)=\myf\nabla\mys+(d\myf)\otimes\mys
    \]
  for $\mys\textcolor{blue!60!black}{\in\Gamma(\myU,\sM)}$ and
  $\myf\textcolor{red!60!black}{\in\cO_M(\myU)}$.
  The rank of the Bundle $\sM$ is the \emph{rank} of the meromorphic connection
  $(\sM,\nabla)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We will occasionally omit the $\nabla$ and simply call $\sM$ the
      meromorphic connection.
    \item Here, the variant `holomorphic bundle with meromorphic connection' is
      chosen, like in \cite{boalch}.
      There is also the twisted\TODO[better word?] description `meromorphic
      bundle with holomorphic connection' which is used in
      \cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic}.
      \\ By choosing a lattice of a meromorphic bundle, one gets a holomorphic
      bundle but the connection is no longer holomorphic. Such that we obtain a
      meromorphic connection in our\dots\TODO
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[0.12.2]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  The connection $\nabla:\cM\to \Omega_M^1\otimes_{\cO_M}\cM$ is said to be
  \emph{integrable} or \emph{flat}, if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item its curvature $R_\nabla\equiv0$
    where
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $R_\nabla:=\nabla\circ\nabla:\cE\to\Omega_M^2\otimes_{\cO_M}\cE$
        is a $\cO_M$-linear morphism.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{prop}[0.12.4]
    The connection $\nabla$ is flat if and only if, in any local basis $e$ of
    $\cM$, the connection matrix $\Omega$ satisfies
    \[
      d\omega + \omega \wedge \omega = 0.
    \]
  \end{prop}
  \begin{rem}
    Here are all connections flat, since \TODO{}
  \end{rem}
  \begin{comment}
    We will say that a connection on a meromorphic bundle is \emph{integrable}
    or \emph{flat} if its restriction to $M\backslash Z$ is an integrable
    connection on the holomorphic bundle $\sM_{|M\backslash Z}$.

We will usually\TODO[only?] be interested in local information of a meromorphic
connection.  This means, that we look at a connection in a neighbourhood of $0$
and allow only one singularity at $0$.
There are many ways of expressing the local information, we will either talk
about germs of meromorphic connections or systems, which is coordinate-
and trivialization-dependent.

  \marginnote{\cite[Def.4.2.1]{Loday2014}}
  A germ $(\cM,\nabla)$ of a meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ is just the
  sheaf-theoretic germ, thus has the form $(\cM,\nabla)$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\cM$ is the germ at $0$ of the holomorphic bundle $\sM$ and thus a
      $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-vectorspace of dimension $n$, since the ring of germs of
      meromorphic functions with poles at $0$ is the ring $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$, and
    \item $\nabla:\cM\to \cM$ \TODO[one forms?] is a additive map, which
      satisfies the \emph{Leibniz rule}
      \[
        \nabla(fm)=\partial f\cdot m + f\nabla(m)

  Choose a $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-basis $\underline{e}=(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n)$ of $\cM$.

Let $x=\sum_{0\leq j\leq n}x_je_j$ be an arbitrary element of $\cM$ which is in
matrix notation described as $x=\underline{e}X$ with the column matrix
$X={}^t\!(x_1,x_2 ,\dots,x_n)$.
Then, applying the Leibniz rule, yields
\begin{align*}
  \nabla x&=\nabla\left(\underline{e}\cdot X\right)
  \\&=\underline{e} \cdot dX - \underline{e}\cdot \nabla X
  \\&=\underline{e}\left(dX-AX\right).
\end{align*}
Thus, with the connection $\nabla$ and the $K$-basis $\underline{e}$ is
naturally associate the differential operator $\nabla=[A]=d-A$, which has order
one and dimension $n$. This means that the connection $\nabla$ is fully
determined by the matrix $A$ and thus is fully determined by $A'$.
\begin{defn}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item This matrix $A$ is called a \emph{connection matrix} of
      $(\cM,\nabla)$. It depends on the choice of the $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-basis.
    \item A \emph{germ of a meromorphic linear differential system} of rank
      $n$, or just a \emph{system}, is a germ of a meromorphic connection on
      the trivial vector bundle \textbf{with a chosen trivialization} of the
      fiber $E\cong\C^n$.
      \begin{prop}
        Thus, the set of systems is isomorphic to the set
        $G(\!\{t\}\!)$ of all connection matrices.

\subsection{Meromorphic / formal transformation}
\begin{comment}\footnotesize
  see \cite{thboalch} \textbf{Rem 1.41 on p. 16}:
  \begin{rem}
    Note that in most of the recent references we have used, Stokes matrices
    are used to classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal meromorphic
        classes, modulo meromorphic equivalence}.
    \end{itemize}
    Whereas here we classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal analytic
        classes, modulo analytic equivalence},
    \end{itemize}
    as is done in the older literature.  The fact is that the sets equivalence
    classes are the same in both cases. \comm{It is important for us to work
      with analytic, rather than meromorphic gauge transformations, because
    then the $\C^\infty$ viewpoint in Chapter 3 is cleaner.} This distinction
    relates to the difference between \textbf{‘regular singular’} connections
    and \textbf{‘logarithmic’} connections.
  \end{rem}
\end{comment}
\begin{notations}
  We will use the following notations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $G=\Gl_n(\C)$;
    \item $G[t]=\Gl_n(\C[t])$;
    \item $G\{t\}=\Gl_n(\C\{t\})$ analytic tranformations;
    \item $G(\!\{t\}\!)=\Gl_n(\C\{t\}[t^{-1}])$ meromorphic transformations;
    \item $G\llbracket t\rrbracket=\Gl_n(\C\llbracket t\rrbracket)$
      (maby not applicable) formal tranformations;
    \item $G(\!(t)\!)=\Gl_n(\C\llbracket t\rrbracket[t^{-1}])$
      (maby not applicable) formal meromorphic tranformations;
  \end{itemize}
\end{notations}
By \emph{transformation} (or \emph{meromorphic transformation}) of a system we
mean a linear change of the trivialization.
Such a change is given by a matrix $F\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$ and the transformed
connection matrix ${}^F\!A$ is obtained through
\[
  {}^F\!A=(dF)F^{-1} + FAF^{-1} \,.
\]
If $F$ is formal i.e.\ $F\in G(\!(t)\!)$, it will usually be denoted by
$\hat F$.
The transformation of $A$ by $\hat F$ is not guaranteed to have convergent
entries.
We denote by $\hat G(A)$ the set of all \emph{(applicable) formal
transformations}
\[
  \hat G(A):=\left\{\hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)
    \mid {}^{\hat F}\!A \text{ has convergent entries i.e.\ } 
    {}^{\hat F}\!A\in G(\!\{t\}\!)
  \right\}\,.

  \def\myB{\textcolor{blue!60!black}{B}}
  \def\myA{\textcolor{green!30!black}{A}}
  \def\myF{\textcolor{red!60!black}{F}}
  The condition
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] $\myB$ is obtained from $\myA$ by transformation $\myF$
  \end{itemize}
  is clearly equivalent to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[]  $\myF$ solves the linear differential system
      \[
        \frac{d\myF}{dt}=\myB\myF-\myF\myA
      \]
      which is denoted by $[\myA,\myB]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{rem}
We define the (formal) equivalence relation on the connection matrices as
\textbf{\boldmath$A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$} if and only if
\textbf{\boldmath$B$ is obtained from $A$ by (formal) transformation}.
Thus $A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$ if and only if there is a (formal)
solution of $[A,B]$.

\begin{defn}
  \TODO[is this a proposition]
  Two germs of meromorphic connections are (formally) isomorphic if and only if
  their corresponding connection matrices are (formally) equivalent.

\subsubsection{Regular / irregular singularities}
\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[86]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  A connection defined by a matrix $A$ has \emph{regular singularity} at $0$ if
  there exists a konvergent transformation, by which $A$ is obtained from a
  matrix with at most a simple pole at $t=0$.
  Otherwise, the singularity is called \emph{irregular}.
  \begin{rem}
    This implies that, if $A$ has irregular/regular singularity, the also all
    meromorphic equivalent matrices ${}^{F}\!A$ have.
  \end{rem}
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
  \marginnote{\cite[Thm.II.2.8]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  Let $(\cM,\nabla)$ be a regular singular meromorphic connection and $A$ its
  connection matrix.
  Then there exists a matrix $F\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$ such that after transformation
  by $F$ the matrix $B={}^F\!A$ takes the form
  \[
    B=B'dt
  \]
  with a constant matrix $B'\in G$.

\subsection{System of ordinary differential equations}
Let $A=A'dt$ be a connection matrix. Then defines
\[
  \frac{d}{dt}v=A'v
\]
a $n$-dimensional system of order one differential equations. From the theory
of ordinary differential equations we know that there is a equivalent ordinary
differential equation of order $n$ which can be written as
\[
  \underset{=:P}{\underbrace{%
      (a_n\partial_t^n+a_{n-1}\partial_t^{n-1}+\cdots a_{1}\partial_t+a_{0})

The important theorem here is the Levelt-Turittin theorem, which solves the
formal classification problem.
\begin{thm}[Levelt-Turittin]
  To each germ $(\cM,\nabla)$ of a meromorphic connection there exists, after
  potentially needed \textcolor{blue!60!black}{pullback by some suitable
  ramification $t=z^q$ of order $q\geq1$}, a
  \textcolor{green!30!black}{\textbf{formal}} isomorphism
  \[
    \textcolor{green!30!black}{\hat{\textcolor{black}{\lambda}}}:
    \textcolor{blue!60!black}{\pi^{+}}
    \textcolor{green!30!black}{\hat{\textcolor{black}{\cM}}}
    \overset{\cong}\longrightarrow
    \textcolor{green!30!black}{\hat{\textcolor{black}{\cM}}^{model}}
    :=\textcolor{green!30!black}{\hat\cO_M\otimes}\cM^{model}
  \]
  to a model $\cM^{model}$.
  We then call $\cM^{model}$ a \emph{formal decomposition} or \emph{formal
  model} of $\cM$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  See \TODO{}
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  \marginnote{\cite[Thm.4.3.1]{Loday2014}}
  To any system $[A]$ there exists a fundamental solution $\mathcal{Y}$ of the
  form $\mathcal{Y}=\hat F t^\Lambda e^{Q(1/t)}$.
\end{cor}

\begin{prop}
  \marginnote{This condition \textbf{might be} equivalent to the
    condition of being \textbf{nice} in~\cite{thboalch}.}
  Let $(\cM,\nabla)$ be a germ,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item equipped with a basis in which the matrix $A$ takes the form
      \[
        A=t^{-r}A(t)\frac{dt}{t}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item $r\geq1$,
        \item $A$ has holomorphic entries, and

          pairwise distinct eigenvalues.}.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  Then there is no ramification needed, to apply the Levelt-Turittin-theorem.

\section{Meromorphic / formal transformation II}
\begin{defn}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An \emph{isotropy} of $A^0$ is a transformation $\hat F$ which
      satisfy ${}^{\hat F}\!A^0=A^0$.
      Thus, the isotropies are the solutions of the system
      $[\End A^0]:=[A^0,A^0]$.
      \marginnote{\cite[853]{Loday1994}}
      \begin{rem}
        They are, a priori, formal transformations. Actually $G(A^0)$ is a
        subgroup of $\Gl_n(\C[1/x,x])$.
      \end{rem}
    \item Let $G_0(A^0)$ denote the set of all isotropies of $A^0$.
      \begin{comment}
        In the nice case this is only $T$?

  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}
  \marginnote{\cite[854]{Loday1994}}
  Two formal transformations $\hat F_1$ and $\hat F_2$ take $A^0$ into
  equivalent matrices ${}^{\hat F_1}\!A^0$ and  ${}^{\hat F_2}\!A^0$ if and
  only if there exists $f_0\in G_0(A^0)$ such that $\hat F_1=\hat F_2f_0$.

\section{The classifying set}
We want to understand the Set $\{[(\cM,\nabla)]\}$ of the (convergent)
isomorphism classes of all meromorphic connections. Since we have also the
formal classification and we know, that all elements in a convergent
isomorphism class lie in the same formal isomorphism class, we can reduce the
problem by fixing a model $(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})$ with the corresponding
connection matrix $A^0$. Thus we can restrict ourself to the subset
\begin{align*}
  {}^0C(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})=\big\{
    \left[(\cM,\nabla)\right]
    &\mid \text{there exists a formal isomorphism }
  \\&\qquad\hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
      \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
      (\hat\cM^{model},\hat\nabla^{model})
  \big\}
\end{align*}
of all isomorphism classes of
meromorphic connections, which are formally isomorphic to
$(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})$. This is the set, that we will be calling the
\emph{classifying set}.

    \item \cite{thboalch} p.6

        \item \cite{boalch} p.19

It is convenient to look at the slightly larger space of \emph{marked pairs}
\[
  \cH=\cH(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})=\left\{
    \left[(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)\right]
      \mid
      \hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
        \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
        (\hat\cM^{model},\hat\nabla^{model})
  \right\}
\]
in which we also keep the additional information, of the formal isomorphism, by
which the meromorphic connection is formally isomorphic to the model.
Where the isomorphisms of marked pairs are defined as follows:
\begin{defn}
  Two germs $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ and $(\cM',\nabla',\hat f')$ are
  isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
  $g:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow(\cM',\nabla')$ such that
  $\hat f=\hat f'\circ \hat g$.
  \begin{comment}
    \cite[111]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}:\dots it is important to remark that
    such an isomorphism is then unique.
  \end{comment}
\end{defn}

Equivalently, one can talk in terms of systems. We then denote by
\[
  \Syst_m(A^0):=\{d-A
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\}
\]
the set of systems formally meromorphic equivalent to $A^0$.
Since we use meromorphic equivalences, in contrast to \cite{boalch,thboalch},
we denote that in $\Syst_m$ by the subscript ${}_m$.
Thus ${}^0C(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})$ corresponds to
the set ${}^0C(A^0):=\Syst_m(A^0)/G(\!\{t\}\!)$ of meromorphic classes which
are formally equivalent to $A^0$.
\TODO[\cite{thboalch} p. 3: In the logarithmic case\dots]
Analogous, $\cH(\cM^{model},\nabla^{model})$ corresponds to the set $\cH(A^0)$ of
equivalence classes in
\[
  \hat\Syst_m(A^0):=\{(A,\hat F)
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\} \,.
\]

\begin{lem}
  Since $G_0(A^0)$ is defined as the stabilizer\TODO[correct?] of $A^0$ we deduce
  \[
    \Syst_m(A^0)\cong \hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0) \,.
  \]
  \begin{cor}
    Thus the \emph{set of meromorphic classas of systems formally equivalent
      to $A^0$} are just the orbits of $G\{t\}$, that is
    \[
      {}^0C(A^0)\cong G\{t\}\backslash\hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0)
    \]
    whereas the \emph{set of meromorphic classes of transformations of $[A^0]$}
    is represented by the left quotient $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.
  \end{cor}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See
  \begin{itemize}
    \item~\cite[6]{thboalch}: in the case $G_0(A^0)=T$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The group $G_0(A^0)$ is easy to compute and is often trivial. In fact, the
elements are block-diagonal, see~\cite[77]{Loday2014}.
Thus the structure of ${}^0C(A^0)$ is easily deduced from the structure of
$G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.

\begin{lem}
  The set $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\cH(A^0)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See~\cite{thboalch}: Lemma 1.17
\end{proof}
