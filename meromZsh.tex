There are multiple languages, which can be used for talking about meromorphic
connections. Firstly the languages of meromorphic connections, and also
$\cD$-modules\TODO[global]. These two can be used to talk about global
information. For local description one can use germs of meromorphic connections
or $\cD$-modules\TODO[local] which are coordinate independent. Coordinate
dependent alternatives are (local) systems and connection matrices. Also,
\rewrite{one can use the fundamental solutions to describe local informations
of meromorphic connections.}

Let $M$ be a riemanian surface and let $Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)>0$ be an
effective divisor\footnote{The $a_i$ are distinct points and the $k_i$ are
positive integers.} on $M$.
It is sufficient to think $M=\P^1$ and $Z=1(0)+1(\infty)$\TODO[\infty?], since
we will only be interested in local information (at $0$).

Let $\sM$ be a holomorphic Bundle over $M$ i.e.\ a locally free $\cO_M$-module
of rank $n$.

A meromorphic connection is then defined as follows.
\begin{defn}
  \def\myU{\textcolor{green!30!black}{U}}
  \def\mys{\textcolor{blue!60!black}{s}}
  \def\myf{\textcolor{red!60!black}{f}}
  A \emph{meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ on $\sM$ with poles on $Z$}
  is defined by a $\C$-linear morphism of sheaves
  \[
    \nabla:\sM\to\Omega_M^1(*Z)\otimes\sM
  \]
  satisfying, for each $\myU\underset{\text{op.}}{\subset} M$, the
  \emph{Leibniz rule}
    \[
      \nabla(\myf\mys)=\myf\nabla\mys+(d\myf)\otimes\mys
    \]
  for $\mys\textcolor{blue!60!black}{\in\Gamma(\myU,\sM)}$ and
  $\myf\textcolor{red!60!black}{\in\cO_M(\myU)}$.
  The rank of the Bundle $\sM$ is the \emph{rank} of the meromorphic connection
  $(\sM,\nabla)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We will occasionally omit the $\nabla$ and simply call $\sM$ the
      meromorphic connection.
    \item Here, the variant `holomorphic bundle with meromorphic connection' is
      chosen, like in \cite{boalch}.
      There is also the twisted\TODO[better word?] description `meromorphic
      bundle with holomorphic connection' which is used in
      \cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic}.
      \\ By choosing a lattice of a meromorphic bundle, one gets a holomorphic
      bundle but the connection is no longer holomorphic. Such that we obtain a
      meromorphic connection in our\dots\TODO
  \end{enumerate}
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[0.12.2]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
  The connection $\nabla:\cM\to \Omega_M^1\otimes_{\cO_M}\cM$ is said to be
  \emph{integrable} or \emph{flat}, if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item its curvature $R_\nabla\equiv0$
    where
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $R_\nabla:=\nabla\circ\nabla:\cE\to\Omega_M^2\otimes_{\cO_M}\cE$
        is a $\cO_M$-linear morphism.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{s-prop}
    \marginnote{\cite[0.12.4]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
    The connection $\nabla$ is flat if and only if, in any local basis $e$ of
    $\cM$, the connection matrix $\Omega$ satisfies
    \[
      d\omega + \omega \wedge \omega = 0.
    \]
    \begin{comment}
      This condition is sufficient to assure the existence of local
      fundamental solutions.
    \end{comment}
  \end{s-prop}
  \begin{s-rem}
    Here are all connections flat, since \TODO[dim $1$?]
  \end{s-rem}
  \begin{comment}
    We will say that a connection on a meromorphic bundle is \emph{integrable}
    or \emph{flat} if its restriction to $M\backslash Z$ is an integrable
    connection on the holomorphic bundle $\sM_{|M\backslash Z}$.

\section{Local expression of meromorphic connections}

\end{comment}
We will usually\TODO[only?] be interested in local information of a meromorphic
connection.  This means, that we look at a connection in a neighbourhood of $0$
and allow only one singularity at $0$.
There are many ways of expressing the local information, we will either talk
about germs of meromorphic connections or systems, which is coordinate-
and trivialization-dependent.
\begin{prop}
  \marginnote{\textbf{\cite[Rem.5.2.4]{hotta2008}}\\\cite[Def.4.2.1]{Loday2014}}
  A germ of a meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ is just the sheaf-theoretic
  germ (at $t=0$), thus has the form $(\cM,\nabla)$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\cM$ is the germ at $0$ of the holomorphic bundle $\sM$ and thus a
      $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-vectorspace of dimension $n$, since the ring of germs of
      meromorphic functions with poles at $0$ is the ring $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$, and
    \item $\nabla:\cM\to \cM$ \TODO[one forms?] is a additive map, which
      satisfies the \emph{Leibniz rule}
      \[
        \nabla(fm)=\partial f\cdot m + f\nabla(m)
      \]
      for all $f\in\C(\!\{t\}\!)$ and $m\in \cM$.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{s-rem}
    \marginnote{\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic}}
    It is a $(\C(\!\{t\}\!),\nabla)$-vectorspace.

      Loday-Richaud calls this in \cite[Def.4.2.1]{Loday2014} a

\end{prop}
\begin{defn}
  A \emph{(iso-)\,morphism of meromorphic connections}
  $\Phi:(\cM,\nabla)\to(\cM',\nabla')$ is a (iso-)\,morphism of
  $\C(\!\{t\}\!)$-vectorspaces $\Phi:\cM\to\cM'$ which commutes with the
  connections.

Let $x=\sum_{0\leq j\leq n}x_je_j$ be an arbitrary element of $\cM$ which is in
matrix notation described as $x=\underline{e}\cdot X$ with the column matrix
$X={}^t\!(x_1,x_2 ,\dots,x_n)$.
Then, applying the Leibniz rule, yields
\begin{align*}
  \nabla x&=\nabla\left(\underline{e}\cdot X\right)
  \\&=\underline{e} \cdot dX - \underline{e}\cdot \nabla X
  \\&=\underline{e}\left(dX-AX\right).
\end{align*}
Hence the condition $\nabla x=0$ is equivalent to the system of ODEs
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ode}
  \frac{d}{dt}x=Ax
\end{equation}
such that horizontal sections of $(\cM,\nabla)$ correspond to solutions of
(\ref{eq:ode}).
Thus, with the connection $\nabla$ and the $K$-basis $\underline{e}$ is
naturally associate the differential operator $\triangle=d-A$, which has order
one and dimension $n$.

      \begin{s-prop}

  see \cite{thboalch} \textbf{Rem 1.41 on p. 16}:
  \begin{rem}
    Note that in most of the recent references we have used, Stokes matrices
    are used to classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal meromorphic
        classes, modulo meromorphic equivalence}.
    \end{itemize}
    Whereas here we classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal analytic
        classes, modulo analytic equivalence},
    \end{itemize}
    as is done in the older literature.  The fact is that the sets equivalence
    classes are the same in both cases. \comm{It is important for us to work
      with analytic, rather than meromorphic gauge transformations, because
    then the $\C^\infty$ viewpoint in Chapter 3 is cleaner.} This distinction
    relates to the difference between \textbf{‘regular singular’} connections
    and \textbf{‘logarithmic’} connections.

\section{Models / formal decomposition of a germ / formal classification}
\marginnote{\cite[Thm.4.3.1]{Loday2014}}
In every formal equivalence class of meromorphic connections, there are some
meromorphic connection of special form, which we will call models. They are not
unique but all of them, which are formally isomorphic to a given meromorphic
connection, lie in the same convergent equivalence class.
In fact, every element of this convergent equivalence class will be a model in
our definition.

The first part is given by the Levelt-Turittin theorem, which says, that
each meromorphic connection is, after potentially needed ramification, formally
isomorphic to such a model.
\TODO[Problems with ramification??]
Thus the Levelt-Turittin theorem solves the \emph{formal classification
problem}.

\subsection{In the language of systems and fundamental solutions}
There is also another way of classifying normal forms, namely by fundamental
solutions. The normal forms are then the systems $[A^0]$, with a fundamental
solution $\cY$ in a special form and from the Levelt-Turittin we then can
deduce that every system $[{}^{\hat F}\!A^0]$, with $\hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)$, has
a fundamental solution in the form $\hat F\cY$.

  % Let $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ be a model of a meromorphic connection,
  % which is represented by the system $[A^0]$.

  \marginnote{\cite[Thm.4.3.1]{Loday2014}}
  The meromorphic connection $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ is a model, if and
  only if there is a basis such that the defined system $[A^0]$ has a
  fundamental solution $\mathcal{Y}_0$ of the form

    \mathcal{Y}_0(t)=t^L e^{Q(t^{-1})}
  \]
  with
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{irregular part} $e^{Q(t^{-1})}$ of $\mathcal{Y}_0$ defind by
      \[

          =\diag(\underset{n_1\text{-times}}{\underbrace{%
          q_1,\dots,q_1}},q_2,\dots,q_s)
      \]
      where the $q_i$ are polynomials in $\frac{1}{t}$ or in a fractional power
      $\frac{1}{s}=\frac{1}{t^{1/p}}$ of $\frac{1}{t}$ such that $q_j(0)=0$,

\section{The classifying set}
We want to understand the Set
$\bigg\{\Big[(\cM,\nabla)\Big]\bigg\}$ of the (convergent)
isomorphism classes of all meromorphic connections. Since we have also the
formal classification and we know, that all elements in a convergent
isomorphism class lie in the same formal isomorphism class, we can reduce the
problem by fixing a model $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ with the corresponding
connection matrix $A^0$. Thus we can restrict ourself to the subset
\begin{multline*}
  {}^0C(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})=\bigg\{
    \Big[(\cM,\nabla)\Big]
    \mid \text{there exists a formal isomorphism }
  \\\qquad\hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
      \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
      (\hat\cM^{nf},\hat\nabla^{nf})
  \bigg\}
\end{multline*}
of all isomorphism classes of meromorphic connections, which are formally
isomorphic to $(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$. This is the set, that we will be
calling the \emph{classifying set} and we will also denote it ${}^0C(A^0)$.

It is convenient to look at the slightly larger space of \emph{marked pairs}
\[
  \cH=\cH(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})=\left\{
    \left[(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)\right]
      \mid
      \hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
        \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
        (\hat\cM^{nf},\hat\nabla^{nf})
  \right\}
\]
in which we also keep the additional information, of the formal isomorphism, by
which the meromorphic connection is formally isomorphic to the model.
Where the isomorphisms of marked pairs are defined as follows:
\begin{defn}
  Two germs $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ and $(\cM',\nabla',\hat f')$ are
  isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
  $g:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow(\cM',\nabla')$ such that
  $\hat f=\hat f'\circ \hat g$.
  \begin{comment}
    \cite[111]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}:\dots it is important to remark that
    such an isomorphism is then unique.
  \end{comment}
\end{defn}

Equivalently, one can talk in terms of systems. We then denote by
\[
  \Syst_m(A^0):=\{d-A
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\}
\]
the set of systems formally meromorphic equivalent to $A^0$.
Since we use meromorphic equivalences, in contrast to \cite{boalch,thboalch},
we denote that in $\Syst_m$ by the subscript ${}_m$.
Thus ${}^0C(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ corresponds to
the set ${}^0C(A^0):=\Syst_m(A^0)/G(\!\{t\}\!)$ of meromorphic classes which
are formally equivalent to $A^0$.
\TODO[\cite{thboalch} p. 3: In the logarithmic case\dots]
Analogous, $\cH(\cM^{nf},\nabla^{nf})$ corresponds to the set $\cH(A^0)$ of
equivalence classes in
\[
  \hat\Syst_m(A^0):=\{(A,\hat F)
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\} \,.
\]

\begin{lem}
  Since $G_0(A^0)$ is defined as the stabilizer\TODO[correct?] of $A^0$ we deduce
  \[
    \Syst_m(A^0)\cong \hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0) \,.
  \]
  \begin{s-cor}
    \marginnote{\cite[Eq.1.9b]{babbitt1983}}
    Thus the \emph{set of meromorphic classas of systems formally equivalent
      to $A^0$} are just the orbits of $G\{t\}$, that is
    \[
      {}^0C(A^0)\cong G\{t\}\backslash\hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0)
    \]
    whereas the \emph{set of meromorphic classes of transformations of $[A^0]$}
    is represented by the left quotient $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.
  \end{s-cor}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See
  \begin{itemize}
    \item~\cite[6]{thboalch}: in the case $G_0(A^0)=T$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The group $G_0(A^0)$ is easy to compute and is often trivial. In fact, the
elements are block-diagonal, see~\cite[77]{Loday2014}.
Thus the structure of ${}^0C(A^0)$ is easily deduced from the structure of
$G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.

\begin{lem}
  The set $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\cH(A^0)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See~\cite{thboalch}: Lemma 1.17
