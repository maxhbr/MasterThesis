There are multiple languages, which can be used for talking about meromorphic
connections. Firstly the languages of meromorphic connections, and also
$\cD$-modules\TODO[global]. These two can be used to talk about global
information. For local description one can use germs of meromorphic connections
or $\cD$-modules\TODO[local] which are coordinate independent. Coordinate
dependent alternatives are (local) systems and connection matrices. Also, one
can use the fundamental solutions to describe local informations of meromophic
connections.

Let $M$ be a riemanian surface and let $Z=k_1(a_1)+\cdots+k_m(a_m)>0$ be an
effective divisor\footnote{The $a_i$ are distinct points and the $k_i$ are
positive integers.} on $M$.
It is sufficient to think $M=\P^1$, since we will only be interested in local
information.

Let $\sM$ be a holomorphic Bundle i.e.\ a locally free $\cO_M$-module of rank
$n$.

A meromorphic connection is then defined as follows.
\begin{defn}
  \def\myU{\textcolor{green!30!black}{U}}
  \def\mys{\textcolor{blue!60!black}{s}}
  \def\myf{\textcolor{red!60!black}{f}}
  A \emph{meromorphic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ on $\sM$ with poles on $Z$}
  is a $\C$-linear morphism of sheaves
  \[
    \nabla:\sM\to\Omega_M^1(*Z)\otimes\sM
  \]
  satisfying, for each $\myU\overset{\text{op.}}{\subset} M$, the
  \emph{Leibniz rule}
    \[
      \nabla(\myf\mys)=\myf\nabla\mys+(d\myf)\otimes\mys
    \]
  for $\mys\textcolor{blue!60!black}{\in\Gamma(\myU,\sM)}$ and
  $\myf\textcolor{red!60!black}{\in\cO_M(\myU)}$.

\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We will occasionally omit the $\nabla$ and simply call $\sM$ the
      meromorphic connection.
    \item Here, the variant `holomorphic bundle with meromorphic connection' is
      chosen, like in \cite{boalch}.  There is also the twisted description
      `meromorphic bundle with holomorphic connection' which is used in
      \cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic}.
      \\ By choosing a lattice of a meromorphic bundle, one gets a holomorphic
      bundle but the connection is no longer holomorphic. Such that we obtain a
      meromorphic connection in our\dots\TODO

\begin{defn}[Flatness (0.12.2)]
  The connection $\nabla:\cM\to \Omega_M^1\otimes_{\cO_M}\cM$ is said to be
  \emph{integrable} or \emph{flat}, if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item its curvature $R_\nabla\equiv0$
    where
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $R_\nabla:=\nabla\circ\nabla:\cE\to\Omega_M^2\otimes_{\cO_M}\cE$
        is a $\cO_M$-linear morphism.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{prop}[0.12.4]
    The connection $\nabla$ is flat if and only if, in any local basis $e$ of
    $\cM$, the connection matrix $\Omega$ satisfies
    \[
      d\omega + \omega \wedge \omega = 0.
    \]
  \end{prop}
  \begin{comment}
    We will say that a connection on a meromorphic bundle is \emph{integrable}
    or \emph{flat} if its restriction to $M\backslash Z$ is an integrable
    connection on the holomorphic bundle $\sM_{|M\backslash Z}$.

We will usually\TODO[only?] be interested in local information of a meromorphic
connection.  This means, that we look at a connection in a neighbourhood of $0$
and allow only one singularity at $0$.
There are many ways of expressing the local information, we will either talk
about germs of meromorphic connections or systems, which is coordinate-
and trivialization-dependent.

A germ $\cM,\nabla)$ of a meromophic connection $(\sM,\nabla)$ is just the
sheaf-theoretic germ, this means that \TODO

  Let $U$ be a trivializing open set for $M$ and let
  $\textbf{e}=(e_1,\dots,e_n)$ be a basis of $\Gamma(U,\sM)$.

  that\dots

    This matrix is called \emph{connection matrix} for $(\sM,\nabla)$.

\begin{defn}
  A \emph{germ of a meromorphic linear differential system} of rank $n$, or
  just a \emph{system}, is a germ of a meromorphic connection on the trivial
  vector bundle\footnote{With a chosen trivialization.} with fibre $E=\C^n$.
\end{defn}
The set of systems is, via the Taylor expansion, isomorphic to
$\End(E)\otimes\C(\!\{t\}\!)$. A matrix
$A'\in\End(E)\otimes\C(\!\{t\}\!)$ determines a system
\[
  \frac{dv}{dt}=A'v
\]
which corresponds to the connection germ $\nabla=[A]=d-A$ on $E$ where
$A=A'dt$.

\subsection{Meromorphic / formal transformation}
\begin{comment}\footnotesize
  see \cite{thboalch} \textbf{Rem 1.41 on p. 16}:
  \begin{rem}
    Note that in most of the recent references we have used, Stokes matrices
    are used to classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal meromorphic
        classes, modulo meromorphic equivalence}.
    \end{itemize}
    Whereas here we classify
    \begin{itemize}
      \item meromorphic connections within fixed \textbf{formal analytic
        classes, modulo analytic equivalence},
    \end{itemize}
    as is done in the older literature.  The fact is that the sets equivalence
    classes are the same in both cases. It is important for us to work with
    analytic, rather than meromorphic gauge transformations, because then the
    $\C^\infty$ viewpoint in Chapter 3 is cleaner. This distinction relates to
    the difference between \textbf{‘regular singular’} connections and
    \textbf{‘logarithmic’} connections.
  \end{rem}
\end{comment}
\begin{notations}
  We will use the following notations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $G=\Gl_n(\C)$;
    \item $G[t]=\Gl_n(\C[t])$;
    \item $G\{t\}=\Gl_n(\C\{t\})$ analytic tranformations;
    \item $G(\!\{t\}\!)=\Gl_n(\C\{t\}[t^{-1}])$ meromorphic transformations;
    \item $G\llbracket t\rrbracket=\Gl_n(\C\llbracket t\rrbracket)$
      (maby not applicable) formal tranformations;
    \item $G(\!(t)\!)=\Gl_n(\C\llbracket t\rrbracket[t^{-1}])$
      (maby not applicable) formal meromorphic tranformations;
  \end{itemize}
\end{notations}
By \emph{transformation} (or \emph{meromorphic transformation}) of a system we
mean a linear change of the trivialization.
Such a change is given by a matrix $F\in G(\!\{t\}\!)$ and the transformed
connection matrix ${}^F\!A$ is obtained through
\[
  {}^F\!A=(dF)F^{-1} + FAF^{-1} \,.
\]
If $F$ is formal i.e.\ $F\in G(\!(t)\!)$, it will usually be denoted by
$\hat F$.
The transformation of $A$ by $\hat F$ is not guaranteed to have convergent
entries.
We denote by $\hat G(A)$ the set of all \emph{(applicable) formal
transformations}
\[
  \hat G(A):=\left\{\hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)
    \mid {}^{\hat F}\!A \text{ has convergent entries}
  \right\}\,.
\]
\begin{rem}
  \def\myB{\textcolor{blue!60!black}{B}}
  \def\myA{\textcolor{green!30!black}{A}}
  \def\myF{\textcolor{red!60!black}{F}}
  The condition
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] $\myB$ is obtained from $\myA$ by transformation $\myF$
  \end{itemize}
  is clearly equivalent to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[]  $\myF$ solves the linear differential system
      \[
        \frac{d\myF}{dt}=\myB\myF-\myF\myA
      \]
      which is denoted by $[\myA,\myB]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{rem}
We define the (formal) equivalence relation on the connection matrices as
\textbf{\boldmath$A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$} if and only if
\textbf{\boldmath$B$ is obtained from $A$ by (formal) transformation}.
Thus $A$ is (formally) equivalent to $B$ if and only if there is a (formal)
solution of $[A,B]$.

\begin{defn}
  \TODO[is this a proposition]
  Two germs of meromorphic connections are (formally) isomorphic if and only if
  their corresponding connection matrices are (formally) equivalent.

\section{Models and formal decomposition of a germ / formal classification}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\switchcolumn[0]\noindent
  As something like building blocks of some meromorphic connections we introduce
  the elementary irregular models. Into which meromorphic connections, after
  potentially needed pullback, decompose.

  The building blocks of these building blocks are defined as follows.
\switchcolumn[1]\noindent
  In every formal equivalence class of meromorphic connections, there are some
  meromorphic connection of special form, which we will call models. They are
  not unique but all of them lie in the same convergent equivalence class.

  On the other hand\TODO[same direction?], the Levelt-Turittin theoreme says,
  that  each meromorphic connection is, after potentially needed ramification,
  formally isomorphic to such a model, that means, that in each formal class
  there are some models.
  \TODO[Problems with ramification??]
  This solves the formal classificaton problem.

\begin{defn}

      \]
      This is the system satisfied by the function $e^\phi$.
      \begin{cor}
        $\cE^\phi$ is determined by the class of $\phi$ in
        $\C\{t\}[t^{-1}]/\C\{t\}=t^{-1}\C[t^{-1}]$. In the following, we will
        only consider the unique element $\phi$ in each class which has no
        holomorphic part.
      \end{cor}
    \item For $\alpha\in\C$, define $\cN_{\alpha,0}$ as the germ
      \[
        (\cN_{\alpha,0},\nabla)=(\C\{t\}[t^{-1}],d+\alpha dt/t)\,.

\section{The classifying set}
We want to understand the Set $\{[(\cM,\nabla)]\}$ of the (convergent)
isomorphism classes of all meromorphic connections. Since we have also the
formal classification and we know, that all elements in a convergent
isomorphism class lie in the same formal isomorphism class, we can reduce the
problem by fixing a model $(\cM^{good},\nabla^{good})$ with the corresponding
connection matrix $A^0$. Thus we can restrict ourself to the subset
\begin{align*}
  {}^0C(\cM^{good},\nabla^{good})=\left\{
    \left[(\cM,\nabla)\right]
      \mid \text{there exists a formal isomorphism }
      \hat f:(\hat\cM,\hat\nabla)
        \overset{\sim}\longrightarrow
        (\hat\cM^{good},\hat\nabla^{good})
  \right\}
\end{align*}
of all isomorphism classes of
meromorphic connections, which are formally isomorphic to
$(\cM^{good},\nabla^{good})$. This is the set, that we will be calling the
\emph{classifying set}.

in which we also keep the additional information, of the formal isomorphism, by
which the meromorphic connection is formally isomorphic to the model.
Where the isomorphisms of marked pairs are defined as follows:
\begin{defn}
  Two germs $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ and $(\cM',\nabla',\hat f')$ are
  isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
  $g:(\cM,\nabla)\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow(\cM',\nabla')$ such that
  $\hat f=\hat f'\circ \hat g$.
  \begin{comment}
    \cite[111]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}:\dots it is important to remark that
    such an isomorphism is then unique.
  \end{comment}
\end{defn}

Equivalently, one can talk in terms of systems. We then denote by
\[
  \Syst_m(A^0):=\{d-A
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\}
\]
the set of systems formally meromorphic equivalent to $A^0$\footnote{Since we
use meromorphic equivalences we denote that by the subscript ${}_m$.}.
Thus ${}^0C(\cM^{good},\nabla^{good})$ corresponds to
the set ${}^0C(A^0):=\Syst_m(A^0)/G(\!\{t\}\!)$ of meromorphic classes which
are formally equivalent to $A^0$.

Analogous, $\cH(\cM^{good},\nabla^{good})$ corresponds to the set $\cH(A^0)$ of
equivalence classes in
\[
  \hat\Syst_m(A^0):=\{(A,\hat F)
    \mid A={}^{\hat F}\!A^0 \text{ for some } \hat F\in G(\!(t)\!)\} \,.
\]

\begin{lem}
  Since $G_0(A^0)$ is defined as the stabilizer\TODO[correct?] of $A^0$ we deduce
  \[
    \Syst_m(A^0)\cong \hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0) \,.
  \]
  \begin{cor}
    Thus the \emph{set of meromorphic classas of systems formally equivalent
      to $A^0$} are just the orbits of $G\{t\}$, that is
    \[
      {}^0C(A^0)\cong G\{t\}\backslash\hat G(A^0)/G_0(A^0)
    \]
    whereas the \emph{set of meromorphic classes of transformations of $[A^0]$}
    is represented by the left quotient $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.
  \end{cor}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \cite[6]{thboalch}: in the case $G_0(A^0)=T$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The group $G_0(A^0)$ is easy to compute and is often trivial. In fact, the
elements are block-diagonal, see \cite[77]{Loday2014}.
Thus the structure of ${}^0C(A^0)$ is easily deduced from the structure of
$G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$.

\begin{lem}
  The set $G\backslash\hat G(A^0)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\cH(A^0)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  See \cite{thboalch}: Lemma 1.17
\end{proof}
