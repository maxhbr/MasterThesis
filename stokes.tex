    \item \cite{Loday2014} Thm. 4.3.9, on p. 78

\end{comment}
Here we will look at the classifying set and we will proof, that it is
isomorphic \TODO[as\dots] to the first non abelian cohomology set
$H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))=:\St(A^0)$.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $D=$\dots
  \item $\tilde D=$\dots
\end{itemize}

Let us now define a Stokes sheaf on $S^1$, as the sheaf of flat
isotropies\TODO[\dots]
\begin{defn}
  The Stokes sheaf $\Lambda(A^0)$ of $A^0$, is the sheaf of groups defined on
  $S^1$ whose stalk at any point $\theta\in S^1$ is the group of germs of
  $f\in\Gl_n(\cO(\mathfrak{s}))$, $\mathfrak{s}$ a sector containing $\theta$, satisfying
  the conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Flatness: $\underset{x\in\mathfrak{s}}{\underset{x\to0}{\lim}}f(x)=1$
      and $f\sim_{\mathfrak{s}} 1$;
    \item Isotropy of $A^0$: ${}^f\!A^0=A^0$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{rem}
    $\Lambda(A^0)$ is the same as $\Aut^{<0}(\tilde\cM^{good})$
    in~\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic} which is defined as follows \TODO
  \end{rem}
\end{defn}

\subsection{The main theoreme}
Let $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ be defined on\dots

\begin{tthm}[Malgrange-Sbuya]
  The homomorphism
  \[
    g:\cH\to\St(A^0)=H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))
  \]
  is an isomorphism of pointed \TODO[which maps \TODO{} to \TODO{}] sets.
  \begin{rem}
    $g$ is just the letter before $h$, which is the next important isomorphism.
  \end{rem}
\end{tthm}
\TODO[\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic} cor II.6.4.]
\begin{rem}
  \marginnote{\cite{Loday1994} Remark I.2.2}
  To another normal form $A_1={}^f\!A_0$ there correspond cochains which are
  conjugated via $f$.
  We get the following commutative diagram:
  \TODO{}
\end{rem}

\subsection{Proof}
We will mainly refer to \cite[section 6.d]{sabbah2007isomonodromic}, where a
more complicated case, with deformation space, is proofen.
\begin{comment}
  See also \cite{BJL1979Birkhoff} and \cite{babbitt1989local} although the proof
  goes back to work from Malgrange and Sibuya (see for example
  \cite{sibuya1990Linear}).
\end{comment}
\begin{proof}
  \textbf{First look at injectivity:}
  Consider the two elements $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)$ and $(\cM',\nabla',\hat f')$
  of $\cH$ which map to same element
  \[
    g((\cM,\nabla,\hat f))=\lambda=g((\cM',\nabla',\hat f'))
      \in H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0)) \,.
  \]
  Since \TODO{}, it is then possible to find a finite covering
  $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ of $S^1$ such that $\lambda$ is the class of the
  cocycles $(f_lf_j^{-1})$ and $(f_l',f_j'^{-1})$, where $f_j$,$f_j'$ are
  defined on $U_j$.
  Then there exists \TODO{} a $0$-cochain $(g_j)$ of the sheaf
  $\Aut^{<0}(\tilde\cM^{good})$ relative to the covering $(I_j)$, such that
  \[
    f_l'f_j'^{-1}=g_lf_lf_j^{-1}g_j^{-1} \text{ on } I_j\cap I_l.
  \]
  \TODO

  \textbf{Now look at surjectivity:}
  Exactly as in \cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic} we will start this part of the
  proof by giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a class $\lambda$ in
  $H^1(S^1,\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))$ to come from an object 
  $(\cM,\nabla,\hat f)\in\cH$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] This is the case if and only if its image in the set
      $H^1(S^1,\Aut_{\cA}(\cM^{good}))$, where we only take the $\cA$-linear
      automorphisms, is the identity.
  \end{itemize}
  \TODO

  Thus, the proof is a consequence of the following Malgrange-Sibuya Theoreme.
  \begin{thm}[Malgrange-Sbuya]
    \marginnote{\cite{sabbah2007isomonodromic} Thm II.6.10}
    The image of the mapping
    \[
      H^1(S^1,\Gl_d^{<0}(\cA_{\tilde D}))
      \to
      H^1(H^1,\Gl_d(\cA_{\tilde D}))
    \] 
    is the identity.
  \end{thm}
  \begin{proof}
     For which we refer to 
     \cite[Th.A.1]{Malgrange1983},
     \cite[Th.6.4.1]{sibuya1990Linear},
     \cite{babbitt1989local}
  \end{proof}
\end{proof}

A covering $\cV$ is said to \emph{refine} a covering $\cU$ if, to each open set
$V\in\cV$ there is at least one $U\in\cU$ with $V\subset U$.
\begin{defn}
  A covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ is called \emph{cyclic covering} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the set $J$ is finite and cyclic $J=\Z/\nu\Z$;
    \item the $U_j$ and, if $\#J>2$, the $U_j\cap U_{j+1}$ are connected arcs on
      $S^1$;
    \item the bisecting directions of the $U_j$ are in ascending order with
      respect to the clockwise orientation of $S^1$;
    \item the $U_j$ are not encased, this means that the arcs
      $U_j\backslash U_l$ are connected arcsz for all $j,l\in J$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  The \emph{nerve} of a cyclic covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ is the family
  $\dot\cU=\{\dot U_j;j\in J\}$ defined by:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $U_j=U_j\cap U_{j+1}$ when $\#J>2$,
    \item $\dot U_1$ and $\dot U_2$ the connected components of $U_1\cap U_2$

We set
\[
  \cQ_{[A^0]}:=\left\{q_1(t^{-1}),\dots,q_n(t^{-1})\right\}
\]
and
\[
  \cQ_{[\End A^0]}:=\left\{\left(q_i-q_l\right)(t^{-1})
    \mid q_i \neq q_l \in\cQ_{[A^0]}
  \right\}
\]
where\dots
\begin{defn}
  We call
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a_{(j,l)}\in\C\backslash\{0\}$ the \emph{leading factor},
    \item $\frac{a_{(j,l)}}{t^k}=:q_{(j,l)}(t^{-1})$ the \emph{leading
      coefficient} and
    \item $k$ the \emph{degree} $\deg(q_j-q_l)$ of $(q_j-q_l)$ or a
      \emph{level} of $A^0$
  \end{itemize}
  of $q_j-q_l\in\cQ_{[\End A^0]}$ if
  \[
    q_j-q_l\in\left\{ \frac{a_{(j,l)}}{t^k}+h \mid h \in o(t^{-k})\right\} \,.
  \]
  \begin{rem}
    In \cite{boalch} and \cite{thboalch} the $k$ is always an integer and
    is incremented by one. We will prefer the other definition, which is
    taken from \cite{Loday1994}, because \TODO
  \end{rem}
  The degrees of the elements in $\cQ_{[\End A^0]}$ are the
  \emph{levels} of $A^0$.
  The set of all levels of $A^0$ will be denoted by
  \[
    \cK=\{k_1<\dots<k_r\} \subset \Q \,.
  \]
  \begin{rem}
    $A^0$ is unramified if and only if $\cK\subset\Z$. Since we only look at
    the unramified case, this will be always the case.
  \end{rem}
\end{defn}

On the elements of $\cQ(A^0)$ we define the following (partial) order
relations:
\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{\cite[Def.I.4.4]{Loday1994}}
  Let $\tilde\theta$ be a determination of $\theta$.
  We define the relations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $q_j \underset{\tilde\theta}{\prec} q_l$
      :\Leftrightarrow{} $\Re(a_{ij}e^{-ik\theta})<0$
    \\\Leftrightarrow{} $e^{(q_j-g_l)(t^{-1})}$ is
      flat\footnote{\TODO[define?]} at $0$ in a neighbourhood of the direction
      $\tilde\theta$.
    \item $q_j \underset{\tilde\theta,\max}{\prec} q_l$
      :\Leftrightarrow{} $a_{ij}e^{-ik\tilde\theta}$ is a real negative number.
      \\\Leftrightarrow{} $e^{(q_j-g_l)(t^{-1})}$ is of maximal
      decay\footnote{\TODO[define?]} in the
      direction $\tilde\theta$.
      \begin{comment}
        \Leftrightarrow{} $q_{ij}(t^{-1})\in\R_{<0}$ along $\tilde\theta$.
      \end{comment}
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
  In the unramified case these relations do not depend on the determination
  $\tilde\theta$ of $\theta$. As a consequence we will only write 
  $\underset{\theta}{\prec}$ and $\underset{\theta,\max}{\prec}$.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
  \marginnote{See
    \cite[Def.I.4.5]{Loday1994}(for the ramified case)
    \cite[Def.3.2]{boalch}}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\theta$ is an \emph{anti-Stokes direction} if there is at least one
      pair $(q_j,q_l)$ in $\cQ(A^0)$, which satisfies 
      $q_j \underset{\theta,\max}{\prec} q_l$.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $\A=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_{\nu}\}$ denote the set of all
          anti-Stokes directions in a clockwise ordering\footnote{In
          \cite{Loday1994} this ordering is chosen, since the calculations are
          then compatible with the calculations, which look at $\infty$ and take
          a counterclockwise ordering. \cite{boalch} and \cite{thboalch} use the
          inverse ordering, but look also at $0$.}. For a uniform notation
          later, define $\A$ to contain a single, arbitrary direction if $k=0$.
      \end{itemize}
    \item $\theta$ is an \emph{Stokes direction} when there is at least one
      pair $(q_j,q_l)$ in $\cQ(A^0)$, which satisfies neither
      $q_j\underset{\theta}{\prec} q_l$. nor $q_l\underset{\theta}{\prec} q_j$.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $\S=\{\sigma_1<\cdots<\sigma_\mu\}$ be the set of Stokes
          directions.

\subsubsection{Stokes group $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$}
\begin{defn}
  Define the \emph{Stokes group}
  \[
    \Sto_\theta(A^0)=
    \left\{\phi_\theta\in\Lambda_\theta^{<0}(A^0)
      \mid \phi_\theta \text{ has maximal decay at } \theta
    \right\}
  \]
  and the group
  \[
    \SSto_d(A^0)= \left\{K\in G\mid K_{jl}=\delta_{jl} \text{ unless }
      q_j \underset{\theta,\max}{\prec} q_l \right\}
  \]
  which will arise as faithfull representation of $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$.
  \begin{rem}
    For $\theta\notin\A$ the group $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$ is trivial, since no flat
    isotropy has maximal decay, but the identity.
  \end{rem}
\end{defn}
For every representation $\tilde\theta$ of $\theta$ there is an isomorphism
\[
  \rho_{\tilde\theta}:\Sto_\theta(A^0)\to\SSto_\theta(A^0)
\]
which maps a germ of $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$ to its faithfull representation. This
process, in the case when $\theta\in\A$, is described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] given
    \begin{itemize}
      \item a normal solution $X_0=t^\Lambda e^{Q(t^{-1})}$ and
      \item a determination $\tilde\theta$ of $\theta$.
    \end{itemize}
    Then denote by $X_{0,\tilde\theta}$ the function defined by $X_0$ with that
    determination of the argument near the direction $\theta$.
\end{itemize}
An element $\phi_\theta(t)\in\Sto_\theta(A^0)$ is thus a flat transformation
such that
\[
  \phi_\theta(t)X_{0,\tilde\theta}(t)
  =X_{0,\tilde\theta}(t)(1_n+C_{\tilde\theta})
\]
for a unique constant invertible matrix of the form $1_n+C_{\tilde\theta}$,
which we will call the \emph{representation of $\phi_\theta$}.
Some little reshaping results in the following equation
\[
  \phi_\theta(t)
  =t^\Lambda e^{Q(t^{-1})}(1_n+C_{\tilde\theta})e^{-Q(t^{-1})}t^{-\Lambda}
\]
and after decomposing\TODO[Fitting the structure of $Q$] $C_{\tilde\theta}$
into 
\begin{align*}
  C_{\tilde\theta}&=\begin{pmatrix}
    c_{(1,1)} & c_{(1,2)} & \cdots &\\
    c_{(2,1} & \ddots\\
    \vdots \\
    & & & c_{(n,n)}
  \end{pmatrix}
\\&=
  \underset{C_{\tilde\theta}^{(1,1)}}{\underbrace{%
    \begin{pmatrix}
      c_{(1,1)} & 0 & \cdots &\\
      0\\
      \vdots&\\
      &
    \end{pmatrix}
  }}
  +
  \underset{C_{\tilde\theta}^{(1,2)}}{\underbrace{%
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & c_{(1,2)} & 0 & \cdots\\
      & 0 &\\
      &\vdots\\
      &
    \end{pmatrix}
  }}
  +\cdots+
  \underset{C_{\tilde\theta}^{(n,n)}}{\underbrace{%
    \begin{pmatrix}
      &\\
      & & & \vdots\\
      & & & 0\\
      & \cdots & 0 & c_{(n,n)}
    \end{pmatrix}
  }}
\\&=\sum_{(l,j)}C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}
\end{align*}
we get
\[
  \phi_\theta=
    t^\Lambda\left(
      1_n+C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}e^{(q_l-q_j)(t^{-1})}
    \right)t^{-\Lambda} \,.
\]

\begin{paracol}{2}

  Thus $\phi_\theta$ is flat in direction $\theta$ if and only if, as soon as
  $e^{(q_l-q_j)(t^{-1})}$ does not have maximal decay in direction
  $\tilde\theta$ the corresponding block $C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}$ is zero.
\switchcolumn[1]\noindent
  Thus, for $\phi_{\tilde\theta}$ to be flat in direction $\theta$, it is
  necessary and sufficient that if $e^{(q_l-q_j)(t^{-1})}$ does not have
  maximal decay in direction $\tilde\theta$ the corresponding block
  $C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}$ vanishes.
\end{paracol}
In particular we get, that
\begin{itemize}
  \item for $j=l$ are the blocks $C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}$ are zero and
  \item if $e^{q_j-q_l}$ has has maximal decay, then $e^{q_l-q_j}$. Thus if
    $C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}$ is not equal to zero, the block 
    $C_{\tilde\theta}^{(j,l)}$ is necessarily zero.
\end{itemize}
This implies that the matrix $1_n+C_{\tilde\theta}$ is unipotent.
On the other hand, every constant unipotent Matrix, with zeros at the necessary
positions, characterizes a unique element of $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$.
Thus $\Sto_\alpha(A^0)$ is a unipotent Lie group.

  A germ $\phi_\theta\in\Lambda_\theta(A^0)$ is a Stokes germ, i.e.\ an element
  in $\Sto_\theta(A^0)$ if and only if for some, hence all determination
  $\tilde\theta$, it has a representation $C_{\tilde\theta}$ of the form 
  $ C_{\tilde\theta}=\sum_{(l,j)}C_{\tilde\theta}^{(l,j)}$.

\subsection{The main theorem}
\marginnote{\cite[868]{Loday1994}}
Let $\{\theta_j\mid j\in J\}\subset S^1$ be a finite set and
$\dot\phi=(\dot\phi_{\theta_j})_{j\in J}\in\prod_{j\in J}\Lambda_{\theta_j}(A^0)$
be a finite family of germs.
In the following way, one can associate a cohomology class to any $\dot\phi$:
let $\dot\phi_j$ be the function representing the germ $\dot\phi_{\theta_j}$ on
its maximal arc of definition $\Omega_j$ around $\theta_j$.
When a cyclic covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ satisfies
$\dot U_j\subset \Omega_j$ for all $j\in J$ one can define the $1$-cocycle
$(\dot\phi_{j|\dot U_j})_{j\in J}$ on $\cU$.
To a differente $\cU$ this construction yields a cohomologous
$1$-cocycle\TODO[Proof], thus the resulting map, in the case
$\{\theta_j\mid j\in J\}=\A$,
\[
  h:\prod_{\alpha\in\A}\Sto_\alpha(A^0)\to
  H^1(A^1;\Lambda(A^0))=\St(A^0)
\]
is welldefined.
\begin{tthm}
  The map
  \[
    h:\prod_{\alpha\in\A}\Sto_\alpha(A^0)\to \St(A^0)
  \]
  is a bijection and natural.
  \begin{rem}
    \marginnote{\cite[869]{Loday1994}}
    Natural means that $h$ commutes to isomorphisms and constructions over
    systems or connections they represent.
