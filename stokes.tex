\end{comment}
Here we will look at the classifying set and we will proof, that it is
isomorphic \TODO[as\dots] to the first non abelian cohomology set
$H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))=:\St(A^0)$.

Let us first define a Stokes sheaf on $S^1$, as the sheaf of flat
isotropies\TODO[\dots]
\begin{defn}
  The Stokes sheaf $\Lambda(A^0)$ of $A^0$, is the sheaf of groups defined on
  $S^1$ whose stalk at any point $\theta\in S^1$ is the group of germs of
  $f\in\Gl_n(\cO(s))$, $\mathfrak{s}$ a sector containing $\theta$, satisfying
  the conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Flatness: $\underset{x\in\mathfrak{s}}{\underset{x\to0}{\lim}}f(x)=1$
      and $f\sim_{\mathfrak{s}} 1$;
    \item Isotropy of $A^0$: ${}^f\!A^0=A^0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

Let $(\sM,\nabla,\hat f)$ be defined on\dots

\begin{thm}
  The homomorphism 
  \[
    \sH\to\St(A^0)=H^1(S^1;\Lambda^{<0}(A^0))
  \]
  is an isomorphism of pointed\footnote{which maps \TODO{} to \TODO{}} sets.
\end{thm}

\begin{rem}
  \marginnote{\cite{Loday1994} Remark I.2.2}
  To another normal form $A_1={}^f\!A_0$ there correspond cochains which are
  conjugated via $f$.
  We get the following commutative diagram:

\end{comment}
A covering $\cV$ is said to \emph{refine} a covering $\cU$ if, to each open set
$V\in\cV$ there is at least one $U\in\cU$ with $V\subset U$.
\begin{defn}
  A covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ is called \emph{cyclic covering} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the set $J$ is finite and cyclic $J=\Z/\nu\Z$;
    \item the $U_j$ and, if $\#J>2$, the $U_j\cap U_{j+1}$ are connected arcs on
      $S^1$;
    \item the bisecting directions of the $U_j$ are in ascending order with
      respect to the clockwise orientation of $S^1$;
    \item the $U_j$ are not encased, this means that the arcs
      $U_j\backslash U_l$ are connected arcsz for all $j,l\in J$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  The \emph{nerve} of a cyclic covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ is the family
  $\dot\cU=\{\dot U_j;j\in J\}$ defined by:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $U_j=U_j\cap U_{j+1}$ when $\#J>2$,
    \item $\dot U_1$ and $\dot U_2$ the connected components of $U_1\cap U_2$
      when $\#J=2$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
The cyclic coverings correspond one-to-one to nerves of cyclic coverings.
\begin{prop}
  \marginnote{\cite{Loday1994} Prop II.1.3}
  \dots $\cV$ refines $\cU$ when each $\dot U_j$ contains at least one
  $\dot V_l$.
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
  A covering $\cU$ beyond which the inductive limit\TODO[which] is stationary
  is said to be \emph{adequate} to describe $H^1(S^1;\Lambda(A^0))$ (or
  \emph{adequate} to $\Lambda(A^0)$).
\end{defn}

\subsection{The main theorem}
\marginnote{\cite[868]{Loday1994}}
Let $\{\theta_j\mid j\in J\}\subset S^1$ be a finite set and
$\dot\phi=(\dot\phi_{\theta_j})_{j\in J}\in\prod_{j\in J}\Lambda_{\theta_j}(A^0)$
be a finite family of germs.
In the following way, one can associate a cohomology class to any $\dot\phi$:
let $\dot\phi_j$ be the function representing the germ $\dot\phi_{\theta_j}$ on
its maximal arc of definition $\Omega_j$ around $\theta_j$.
When a cyclic covering $\cU=\{U_j;j\in J\}$ satisfies
$\dot U_j\subset \Omega_j$ for all $j\in J$ one can define the $1$-cocycle
$(\dot\phi_{j|\dot U_j})_{j\in J}$ on $\cU$.
To a differente $\cU$ this construction yields a cohomologous
$1$-cocycle\TODO[Proof], thus the resulting map, in the case
$\{\theta_j\mid j\in J\}=\A$,
\[
  h:\prod_{\alpha\in\A}\Sto_\alpha(A^0)\to 
  H^1(A^1;\Lambda(A^0))=\St(A^0)
\]
is welldefined.
\begin{thm}
  The map
  \[
    h:\prod_{\alpha\in\A}\Sto_\alpha(A^0)\to \St(A^0)
  \]
  is a bijection and natural.
  \begin{rem}
    \marginnote{\cite[869]{Loday1994}}
    Natural means that $h$ commutes to isomorphisms and constructions over
    systems or connections they represent.
    \begin{comment}
      See \cite{Loday1994} Section III.3.3
    \end{comment}
  \end{rem}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Proof}
We will only look at the unramified case, the proof in the ramified case can be
found in \cite{Loday1994} section II.4.
